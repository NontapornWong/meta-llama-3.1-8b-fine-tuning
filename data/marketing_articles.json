    "title": "How Content Audits Help The HubSpot Blog Age Backwards — A Peek Into Our Process",
    "content": "In 2023, my team and I began working on perhaps one of the most ambitious content audits ever conducted on the HubSpot Blog. We’ve run content audits in the past — but not like this. We ran the audit in three phases: Phase 1 addressed our oldest content. Phase 2 evaluated our lowest-performing content. Phase 3 assessed the value of our topic clusters. When it was all said and done, we audited over 10,000 blog post URLs and over 450 topic clusters. In this post, I’m going to focus on phase one of our audit. I’ll walk you through how we audited our oldest content and how we took action. Plus, I’ll share the results we found. But first, let me give you some background on why we decided to run an audit of this magnitude. Why We Audited It all started in early 2023. At the time, my team was called the Historical Optimization team and we sat at the intersection of HubSpot’s SEO and Blog teams. We were responsible for updating and optimizing our existing blog posts and finding growth opportunities within our library. (We’ve since evolved into what is now the EN Blog Strategy team.) In case you’re new here, the HubSpot Blog is HUGE. For context, the blog was home to 13,822 pages in February of 2023, the month we began our audit. While we are fortunate to have a high domain authority and drive millions of visits per month, having a blog of this size does not come without challenges. As our library ages, the amount of opportunity for new content across our blog properties and clusters shrinks. So, we decided to audit our library to find opportunities for optimization. We hypothesized that we could uncover “greenspace” and “quasi-greenspace” — topics that we have covered but haven’t capitalized on that well — by auditing the oldest 4,000 URLs in our library. Although this was only about a third of our content library, we believed we’d be able to unearth some traffic opportunities and give our blog a boost.HubSpot's Guide to Navigating EEAT in the AI Era Discover how HubSpot tackled SERP volatility and redefined its strategy to thrive in the new EEAT landscape.

However, another part of that algorithm update emphasized content freshness and helpfulness. In other words, how cutting-edge and useful our content is to our readers. This is where we really felt a sense of urgency. Because we had 4,000 URLs with published dates ranging from 2006 to 2015, we already knew that this chunk of content was not fresh or helpful. So, we got to work and audited those blog posts over the course of ten weeks. Eventually, we added phases two and three to our plan so we could further address unhelpful content and clusters. Note: In addition to these content audits, we continually re-evaluate the relevance of past content strategies and prune posts that no longer serve our audience, such as our posts on Famous Quotes, How to Write a Resignation Letter, and How to Type the Shrug Emoji. How We Audited Our Oldest Content 1. Define our goals. Before we started auditing the content, it was important for us to determine the objectives. For some publishers, the goal of a content audit may include improving on-page SEO, enhancing user engagement, aligning content with marketing goals, or identifying content gaps. For this particular audit, it meant uncovering “greenspace” and “quasi-greenspace” in our blog library, and improving our overall content freshness. We also had to determine the scope of our audit. There’s no right or wrong way to approach this. Depending on your goals and the size of your website, you could audit the whole thing in one go. You could also start with a small portion of your site (such as product pages or specific topic clusters) and build out from there. Since HubSpot has such a large content library, we opted to limit this audit to our oldest 4,000 URLs. Not only was this more manageable than reviewing all of our content in one audit, but this also targeted URLs that were more likely to benefit from an update or prune. We also did this knowing that we would later address the rest of our library during phases two and three. 2. Gather our content inventory. Once we established our goals and scope, we had to gather the oldest 4,000 blog posts and put them into a spreadsheet. This process can vary depending on the tools and CMS you use. Here’s how we did it using Content Hub: 1. Log into HubSpot and navigate to the Blog page in Content Hub. 2. Navigate to the Actions drop-down and click Export blog posts. 3. Select File format and click Export. This will send all of your blog post information to your email. You will also get a notification in HubSpot once your export is ready. 4. Audit Insights Out of the 4,000 URLs we audited, 951 (23.78%) were categorized as posts with organic potential and recommended for optimization or recycling. Additionally, 2,888 URLs were recommended to be pruned. That’s about 72.2% of the audit. These posts either did not have organic potential, posed a cannibalization risk, or were so outdated that there was no point in updating them. The remaining 161 URLs either did not require any action or had already been redirected. How We Took Action The action taken for a URL was determined by its potential for organic traffic. The URLs with organic potential were delivered to our Blog team and recommended to be optimized or recycled. Meanwhile, the URLs with no organic potential were delivered to our SEO team and recommended to be archived or redirected. First, let’s walk through how we took action on the posts recommended to be optimized or recycled. Taking Action on Content with Organic Potential Before addressing any of the 951 posts with organic potential, we needed to figure out the following: Our capacity for strategic analysis and brief writing The capacity of our in-house writing staff and available freelancers Our capacity to edit the updates We coordinated with stakeholders and determined we only had the bandwidth to update 240 posts in 2024 (in addition to the dozens of blog posts we update each month). This initiative was internally known as the “De-Age the Blog Project” and was led by my EN Blog Strategy teammate Kimberly Turner. Once we knew how many posts we could take on, we had to narrow down which ones to prioritize. We did this by evaluating the complexity of the lift required for each post update: Simple Update: The content updates needed are relatively light, making them suitable for freelancers. Complex Update: The content updates needed are heavy, making them better suited for in-house writers. Recycle: Content is not salvageable, but the URL is. Rewrite the post from scratch, but retain the URL. No Opportunity: Pass on updating. We originally prioritized updating the simplest URLs first, but later pivoted our strategy to tackle the URLs with the highest MSV potential, regardless of update complexity. We did this because we wanted to get the most we could out of our updates. De-Age the Blog Results Initially, we projected that these updates would be complete by the end of H1 2024, but we had to shift our strategy … again. Like many other publishers, we felt the effects of Google’s March 2024 Core Update as well as the introduction of AI Overviews. After having placed the De-Age the Blog Project on hold while we addressed the issues, we deprioritized the project entirely in favor of higher-impact workstreams. SEO, am I right? It always keeps you on your toes. Despite sunsetting the project before it was complete, we were still able to perform 76 post updates. Six months after the updates were implemented, the cumulative monthly traffic for these posts had increased by 458%. This goes to show that even updating a small portion of URLs can make a big difference. Taking Action on Content with No Organic Potential While the De-Age the Blog Project was taking place, we also took action on the 2,888 URLs that were recommended to be pruned. Since the initial audit didn’t include recommendations on how to prune, we had to go back and re-review each URL to determine how we would prune. Here’s how we evaluated the posts: Archive (404): The URL has less than 10 backlinks and the backlink profile does not have value. Redirect (301): The URL has more than 10 backlinks and/or the backlink profile has value. When choosing a new URL, we did our best to pick the most relevant and similar page. If we couldn’t find one, we redirected to the pillar page of the cluster that the post belonged to. If for some reason, the URL didn’t belong to a cluster or there wasn’t a pillar page, we redirected it to the HubSpot Blog homepage. Decision-making for some content types was easier than others. For example, we were able to automatically assign 301 redirects to URLs that were flagged for cannibalization during the initial audit. We also automatically assigned 404s to URLs with less than 10 backlinks labeled as Newsjacking and Business Updates. Everything else was manually reviewed to ensure accuracy. To make the evaluation process easier, we followed this decision tree: It took my team about two and a half weeks to ensure that every URL had the correct label. In the end, we had 1,675 URLs assigned to be redirected and 1,210 URLs assigned to be unpublished and archived. Once each URL was evaluated, we were finally ready to take action. After coordinating with Rory and Principal Technical SEO Strategist, Sylvain Charbit, we decided to prune the URLs in batches instead of all at once. That way, we could better monitor the impact of redirecting and archiving a large quantity of content. Originally, we planned to implement our prune in five batches over five weeks, allowing us time to monitor performance during the weeks in between. Batches one and two contained URLs meant to be archived and unpublished, and batches three through five contained URLs designated for 301 redirects. Because there were so many URLs to unpublish and archive, we worked with developers on HubSpot’s Digital Experience team to create a script that would automatically unpublish and archive URLs and redirect them to our 404 page. Then, we were able to implement the 301 redirects with the Bulk URL Redirect tool in Content Hub. Note: Although we were able to work through this process internally and finish before our deadline, I want to acknowledge that manually evaluating over 2,000 URLs can be tedious and time-consuming. Depending on your resources and the scope of your audit, you may want to consider hiring a freelancer to help your team work through a task this large. Content Pruning Results While we successfully implemented each batch, this process didn’t come without a few road bumps. Midway through our pruning schedule, Google rolled out the March 2024 Core Algorithm Update. We ended up placing our pruning schedule on hold so we could better monitor performance during the update. Once the update was complete, we resumed the rest of our prune until it was complete. Because of the volatile search landscape in 2024, we didn’t see the traffic gains we’d hoped to see once the prune was complete. However, we did celebrate a massive win for overall content freshness on the blog. At the start of our audit in 2023, we calculated the freshness of our content library by looking at each URL's publish date and quantifying the number of days since they were updated. For example, say the current date is November 12, 2024, and you have a post that was last updated on February 19, 2008. Based on the 2024 date, the post from 2008 is 16.7 years old or 6,110 days. Once we had all of the ages for every post on the HubSpot Blog, we averaged those numbers to determine the average age of our content library, which was 2,088 days (5.7 years). Since pruning 2,888 URLs (and updating hundreds of URLs from the audit and beyond), the HubSpot Blog's average age has dropped to 1,747 days — that’s 341 days younger than when we started. As content freshness and helpfulness play an even greater role in search algorithms, being nearly a year younger can make a big difference. What’s Next? Earlier in this post, I mentioned that this audit is only one of three that my team has worked on in 2024. Our phase two audit focuses on the lowest-performing posts that were not included in phase one, totaling over 6000 URLs. Then, phase three assesses the value of our Blog’s topic clusters. We’re still taking action on the results from these audits, but I’m so excited to share the process and insights when they’re complete. Ultimately, content auditing is a job that is never truly done — especially when working with large libraries. You finish one audit, then it’s on to the next. Although the work can be tedious, the rewards of improving content quality, user experience, and performance make it worth the effort.",

    "content": "I fully admit I’m terminally uncool. But as a marketer, I can’t let my lack of swag (rizz? drip?) be an excuse for being behind the times and not knowing how to use Instagram. With nearly 2 billion users, I’ve gotta be. Luckily, I’m surrounded by veteran marketers and social media experts who can teach me — and I’m going to pay it forward by sharing their insights with you. First, we’ll cover the basics: what Instagram is and what its purpose is. Then, we’ll explore how to KitWhat is Instagram? Instagram is a social media platform that emphasizes photo and video sharing via its mobile app. You can take, edit, and publish visual content for both followers and non-followers as long as your account is public. Users can interact with your content via likes, comments, shares, and saves. It is owned by Facebook's parent company Meta which runs its robust ads platform and it welcomes over 2 Billion monthly active users.Instagram — IG or Insta, for people cooler than me — was once just a photo-sharing social platform. Back then, “Do it for the 'gram” was a common saying: “Do something fun/funny/risky so we can take a picture and post it to Instagram.” Since then, Instagram has become a full-fledged visual platform with a heavier emphasis on video and interactive elements via Stickers. (And “Do it for the ‘gram” has apparently fallen out of style.) If you‘re not part of the one billion users on Instagram, you might want to reconsider. As a consumer, the app offers a great chance to stay a part of friends’ lives. Plus, you can follow your favorite celebrities, influencers, or public figures to see candid photos of their everyday lives. For brands, it's a phenomenal platform for connecting with their audience. For instance, Taco Bell uses Instagram Stories to promote new menu items you won't find anywhere else.How Does Instagram Work? The idea is simple: Users from anywhere in the world create private or public accounts. They follow and are followed by other users, engage with them and their content, and upload videos and photos to be engaged with in return. (Or you can be a lurker who just checks out everyone else’s content and never posts or engages — but no one likes that.) User accounts can represent individuals or groups like organizations, businesses, or brands. We’ll dig deeper into the details as you read on. Instagram FAQs Can I Instagram for Business Kit Learn how to KitHow to Create an Instagram Account You can sign up for Instagram via the app or going to Instagram.com. Either way, just click the ‘Sign Up’ button. You can choose to sign up through Facebook or use your email or phone number. After you choose a username and password, you’re ready to build your profile.I was surprised and delighted by how easy it was to KitHow to Upload an Image or Video to Your Stories Instagram Stories is a feature that allows you to post videos or images that disappear after 24 hours. Why would you want that? It can encourage highly engaged fans to keep returning to your IG page. It's very similar to Snapchat in terms of content — users often post more casual and candid videos and images, offering glimpses into their everyday lives. For instance, on your normal feed, you might post a heavily-edited picture of yourself and friends at a baseball game. But you might post a more candid video to your Story of the stadium singing “Sweet Caroline”. To learn how to upload an image or video to your Stories, follow these steps: 1. Tap your profile picture in the upper left-hand corner. Alternatively, swipe right on your feed or tap the “+” button in the top navigation bar. 2. Capture or add your media. Once you‘re within the Stories feature, you can take a picture or video right from within the app. Alternatively, if you have an image saved to your phone that you’d like to use, you can choose it from your media library. 3. Add stickers or filters. On the left-hand side, you have a few different editing features. The “Create” button lets you add a location, hashtag, time, date, and other fun images or emojis to your picture. The “Boomerang” option allows you to create a looping video. And the “Aa” icon is your text button. Once you click “Aa”, you have the option to change your font. If you click the smiley face icon, you‘ll see the following screen. Simply click on one of the icons to add them to your image. If you don’t like it, drag it to the bottom, and a trash can will appear so you can delete it. For instance, I clicked the smiley face icon to add a poll to my image. You can also swipe to the left or right to add filters to your photo or video. 4. Publish your Story. Once you're happy with your content, you can either click the white arrow icon in the bottom right, which allows you to share your Story with everyone who follows you, or select “Close Friends” first so that only your close friends see it. Then you’re done! Your Story is immediately live. Note: You can also schedule both video and image content in advance directly within the Instagram app or with a variety of third-party tools, including HubSpot. How to Follow People on Instagram It’s incredibly easy to find and follow users. If you know who you want to follow, just use the search feature to look for celebrities, brands, or friends. Or, if you know what type of content you want to find but aren’t sure who posts it, you can search for “tags.” For instance, if you search “#familyrecipes” under tags, your results will include any images with that hashtag. As you scroll, you might find someone who posts content you really like, and you can choose to follow them so their content appears on your feed. I instantly fell in love with Dog.Derp.of.the.Day, so that was my second follow (after my wife.) To follow someone, follow these three easy steps. 1. Click on the search icon at the bottom of your screen. It looks like a magnifying glass and will be next to the “Home” button. 2. Next, type in a person, brand, or topic. For this example, because I love derpy dogs, I searched the topic \"dog derps.” Instagram allows you to either search all posts that contain combinations of those words, or “See all results” and see tags and places. 3. Tap the account you’re interested in following. Once you‘re on someone else’s account, you'll see a blue “Follow” button at the top. For public profiles, you can click and immediately begin following that account. However, if the profile is private, you may need to wait for them to accept you first.Can you connect to Instagram to other social accounts? Yes, you can connect Instagram to Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr. Does that mean you can save time by pumping out the same content on every platform? Uh… not so fast. “In an ideal world, content across all of your brand’s individual social platforms are bespoke for different platforms to align with platform user behavior,” says Emily Kearns. In other words, what works on Instagram might not land with a Threads audience. So, what’s the point of connecting accounts? “Connecting IG to other accounts allows for cross-promotion so a user can KitHow to Connect Instagram to Other Social Accounts Since IG and Facebook are both Meta products, you can choose to automatically share your posts to both platforms at the same time. (I’ll show you how in just a moment.) Otherwise, you’ll need to cross-post on a per-post basis. Meta seems to change the process almost monthly, but here’s how you currently accomplish that: 1. Tap on your profile picture in the bottom right. 2. Tap the gear icon in the top left. 3. Tap “See more in Accounts Center” 4. Tap “Connected experiences” 5. Tap “Sharing across profiles” 6. Select the account you want to connect. 7. Select the account to “Share from” and then the account to “Share To” 8. Select the type of posts to share automatically. Once you’ve connected your accounts for one post, you can then toggle the sharing options for any new posts without needing to sign in again. If you connect Instagram to Facebook, you can share your Stories across both accounts. We will talk more about how to do that below. Data-Backed Instagram Marketing Tips Here are four tips from a recent HubSpot Blog survey of nearly 700 global Instagram marketers: 1. Be strategic with your scheduling. Over 50% of marketers say Friday is the best day for engagement. Of course, every audience is different, but this is a solid benchmark to start experimenting with. 2. Pop those tags. The majority of marketers used 10-15 hashtags on a given post. Be sure to choose tags that are relevant to your product but also likely to be searched (like PandaDoc). 3. Flaunt it if you got it. 36.9% of marketers report that showcasing products and services Kit",

    "content": "For most of us, digital forms a significant part of our overall marketing strategies. Consumers and businesses alike are almost always online and on the go, so you want to be able to reach them wherever they are.But this ever-changing digital landscape can quickly become overwhelming. I've put to Marketing Plan Template Outline your company's marketing strategy in one simple, coherent plan. Pre-Sectioned Template Completely Customizable Example Prompts Professionally DesignedOwned, Earned, and Paid Media Framework Example Say I have an owned piece of content on a landing page on my website that's been created to help me generate leads. I know I want to incorporate different parts of the framework rather than just working with owned, earned, or paid media alone. To amplify the number of leads the content generates, I ensure it's shareable so my audience can distribute it via their social media profiles. In return, this will increase traffic to my landing page. This is the earned media component. To support my content's success, I might post about the content on my Facebook page and pay to have it seen by more people in my target audience. This is how the three parts of the framework can work together, although it's not necessary for success. For instance, if my owned and earned media are already both successful, I might not need to invest in paid methods. I recommend evaluating what solution will help you best meet your goals and then incorporating those channels into your digital marketing strategy. Featured Resource: Keep track of your paid media efforts with HubSpot's free Paid Media Template. 4. Audit and plan your owned media campaigns. At the heart of digital marketing is owned media — and it almost always comes in the form of content. That’s because nearly every message your brand broadcasts can be classified as content, whether it’s an About Us site page, product descriptions, blog posts, ebooks, infographics, podcasts, or social media posts. Content helps convert your website visitors into leads and customers while improving your brand’s online presence. And when this content is search engine optimized, it can boost your search and organic traffic. Whatever your digital marketing strategy goal is, you'll want to incorporate owned content. To start, decide what content will help you reach your goals. Continuing with the example from above, my goal is to generate 50% more leads on my website this year. My About Us page is probably useless to my strategy unless it’s somehow been a lead-generation machine in the past. If you’re feeling stuck, below I’ve outlined a brief process you can follow to work out what owned content you need to meet your digital marketing strategy goals. Audit your existing content. I promise marketing audits are significantly less scary than any other type of audit and much simpler. Just make a list of your existing owned content, then rank each item according to what has previously performed best concerning your current goals. For example, if your goal is lead generation, rank your content according to which pieces generated the most leads over the last year (such as a blog post, ebook, or site page). The idea here is to figure out what’s currently working, and what’s not so that you can set yourself up for success when planning future content. Identify gaps in your existing content. Based on your buyer personas, identify any gaps in the content you have. For example, if you're a math tutoring company and know through research that a major challenge for your personas is finding effective ways to study, create some. By looking at your content audit, you might discover that ebooks hosted on a certain type of landing page convert really well (better than webinars, for example). In the case of this math tutoring company, you might make the decision to add an ebook about “how to make studying more effective” to your content creation plans. Create a content creation plan. Based on your findings and the gaps you’ve identified, make a content creation plan outlining the content that’s necessary to help you hit your goals. This should include: A title. Format. A goal. Promotional channels. Why you're creating the content. The priority level of the content. This can be a simple spreadsheet and should also include budget information if you‘re planning to outsource the content creation or a time estimate if you’re producing it yourself. 5. Audit and plan your earned media campaigns. Evaluating your previous earned media against your current goals can help you get an idea of where to focus your time. Look at where your traffic and leads are coming from (if that's your goal) and rank each earned media source from most effective to least effective. You can obtain this information using tools like the Sources reports in HubSpot's Traffic Analytics tool. You may find a particular article you contributed to the industry press drove a lot of qualified traffic to your website, which boosted conversions. Or, you may discover that LinkedIn is where you see most people sharing content, which increases traffic. The idea is to build a picture of what types of earned media will help you reach your goals (and what won’t) based on historical data. However, if there’s something new you want to experiment with, don’t rule it out just because it’s never been done before. 6. Audit and plan your paid media campaigns. Auditing your paid media campaigns (also a simple, no-frills audit) is the same process: evaluate your existing paid media across each platform (e.g. Google Ads, Facebook, X, etc.) and identify what’s most likely to help you meet your current goals. Say, for example, you spend a lot of money on ads and find that you don’t get the results you’d hoped for. It might be time to refine your approach or scrap it all together and focus on another platform that yields better results. Featured Resource: Use this Google Ads PPC Kit to learn how to leverage Google Ads for your digital marketing strategy. By the end of the process, you should have a clear idea of which paid media platforms you want to continue using and which (if any) you'd like to remove from your strategy. 7. Bring your digital marketing campaign together. You've done the planning and the research, and you now have a solid vision of the elements that will make up your digital marketing strategy. To review, here's what you should have solidified so far: Clear profile(s) of your buyer persona(s). One or more digital marketing-specific goals. An inventory of your existing owned, earned, and paid media. An audit of your existing owned, earned, and paid media. An owned content creation plan or wish list. Now, you bring all of your findings together to plan the campaign(s) that will make up your digital marketing strategy. A better understanding of digital marketing strategies is vital to your ultimate success. Earning a bachelor’s in marketing or a related field can be valuable and boost your career.

Here are some common, effective strategies that can help you build a comprehensive digital marketing plan. 1. Content Marketing Content marketing involves creating and sharing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and engage your target audience. Instead of bombarding your audience with ads and promotional messages, content marketing focuses on providing your customers with information that is interesting and useful to them. Ultimately, the goal of content marketing is to build trust, establish thought leadership, and drive profitable customer action. There are two major trends in content marketing we’re seeing in 2025: Visual storytelling and value-driven content. Visual Storytelling is the New Norm Short-form video, images, and live-streaming video were among the most commonly used — and highest ROI — content formats in 2024, and our research shows that marketers are increasing their investment in these visual storytelling formats in 2025. This increase is partly because marketers are shifting their focus to younger audiences. Brands are Increasingly Value-Driven Younger customers are also more likely to seek out brands whose values align with their own. Content marketers are meeting that demand by creating more content that reflects their brand’s values — 21% of respondents said they’re exploring this trend in 2025. Brand-led marketing strategies in general are increasing in popularity, as marketers zero in on brand awareness and their customers’ experiences with their brand. Since buyers view around three to five pieces of content before engaging with a sales rep, content marketing is how you give them what they’re looking for. And although we’re seeing a smaller proportion of marketers who are putting more resources toward blogging, 15% still told us that they’re increasing their investment in 2025. Blogging is a major play for businesses that want to attract customers who are genuinely interested in their products and services. And well-written, well-researched blog posts often answer an urgent need for a potential customer. For instance, HubSpot sells marketing software, and our users are typically marketing professionals who create plans, campaigns, and editorial calendars for their employers. Recognizing this, Hubspot offers a free blog maker to help you get started on publishing content that resonates with your audience, ensuring you can easily share your knowledge and insights without the technical hassle. The key is not to blog just because: Blog with the intent to solve for the customer. To effectively do so, it’s important to understand your target audience and their pain points. That way, you can write highly targeted content that’s genuinely helpful for readers, especially since consumers say they read between one and four blog posts per month. Online Marketing Benefits of Content Marketing Boosts web traffic: Regularly publishing fresh and relevant blog content can improve your SEO rankings, attracting more organic visitors to your website. Plus, sharing content on your social media pages and other channels can help you stay engaged with your audience while increasing visibility. Establishes authority and credibility: Sharing your expertise and insights through blog articles and other content can help establish you and your company as a thought leader in your industry. This also allows you to engage with your audience and provide them with useful information that speaks to their pain points. Not only does this build trust, but it also positions you as a reliable and knowledgeable resource. Generates leads and conversions: By creating engaging and relevant content, you can attract potential customers who are interested in your business and move them through the buyer’s journey. You can also convert readers into leads by including CTAs that encourage readers to take action, such as subscribing to a newsletter or registering for a free trial. Recommended Reading Why Blog?

Influencer Marketing The global market for influencer marketing has quadrupled since 2019, and we’re seeing a particular rise in niche-influencer marketing in 2025. By partnering with influencers, brands can create content that promotes their products or services while leveraging the influencer’s reach. There are many ways you can partner with influencers, such as sponsored content, guest blogging, product collaborations, influencer takeovers, and more. Before partnering with an influencer, it’s important to do your research and make sure they have an engaged following within your industry or niche and are aligned with your values and messaging. Not sure how to get started? Check out HubSpot’s Ultimate Guide to Influencer Marketing. Featured Resource: The Ultimate Guide to Influencer Marketing Influencer marketing might seem unattainable from a cost perspective, as most businesses don’t have A-list budgets. But as Eric Munn, the director of marketing for the Chicago Transit Authority who was featured in our Masters in Marketing newsletter, points out, local and regional influencers can be quite affordable and have valuable audiences. “Our campaign was focused on using the CTA because it saves you money, which means more money in your pocket to go do all of the things that Chicago has to offer.” So Munn turned to Chicagoland influencers who make videos with themes like “five things to do in Chicago this weekend” or “Chicago’s hidden gems.” Followers of those influencers were very likely to be in the CTA’s target audience already, making it a valuable marketing play — but without paying national influencer prices. Many marketers prefer working with niche influencers and find them the most effective, which makes sense — the cost is lower, and these influencers typically have a stronger bond with a smaller and more engaged community, ready and open to hear from them. Online Marketing Benefits of Influencer Marketing Brand exposure: Partnering with influencers allows you to tap into the influencer’s existing audience and reach, which can significantly boost your brand’s awareness. By leveraging an influencer’s platform and following, you can expose your products or services to a larger audience and gain visibility among potential new customers. Authentic content creation: Influencers are skilled in creating engaging and authentic content that resonates with their followers. By partnering with influencers, you can tap into their creativity and expertise to develop compelling content that promotes your brand’s offerings in an organic and relatable manner. Plus, user-generated content created by influencers can showcase real-life experiences with your brand, which can influence buyer decisions and foster trust. Trust and credibility: Influencers are seen as trusted authorities within their niches. When they endorse or recommend a brand’s products or services, it adds credibility and trust. This can positively influence consumer perceptions and increase the likelihood of potential customers trying or purchasing from your brand.

Social Media Marketing Social media marketing is another way to generate brand awareness online and boost your digital strategy. It involves creating and sharing content on social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, X, and others, to attract attention, drive website traffic, and generate leads. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kim | Bookstagrammer (@books.all.the.way.down) Visual storytelling is a natural fit for social media. In 2024, short-form video, images, and livestreaming video were among the most commonly used content, and we’re only seeing that trend accelerate. Heading into 2025, all three formats are seeing increased investment by a higher proportion of marketers than all other formats. Marketers are shifting their social media strategies to accommodate visually rich storytelling — and they’re hiring more social media pros at all levels. Social media marketing is also great for building communities around your brand. You can speak directly to your audience, engage with followers through comments and messages, and have discussions to connect with them on a more personal level. According to our research, more and more marketing teams — 20% of the marketers we surveyed — are exploring using social media DMs for customer service. The stronger your relationship with your audience, the more loyal they will be to your brand. Online Marketing Benefits of Social Media Marketing Increases brand awareness: With billions of active social media users, you can reach a wide audience and increase your brand’s visibility. This is especially true if you participate in relevant social media trends, run paid campaigns, create and promote branded hashtags, and collaborate with other brands. Boosts engagement: A strong social media presence can help create a community around your brand and build a strong relationship with your followers. Plus, you can use tactics like contests and giveaways to encourage specific actions that support your marketing goals, such as asking users to tag a friend or write a review. Rich insights and analytics: Social media platforms typically provide robust analytics tools that allow you to measure the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns, track key metrics, and gain insights for continuous improvement.

Paid Advertising An organic content marketing strategy is only a portion of the story. It’s just as important to implement non-organic plays, such as paid advertising. Not only will this help you drive more brand awareness, but it will also help you reach audiences who can’t find your business organically yet. I recommend paid advertising if you’re still growing your blog or business and not getting as much traffic as you want. There are a few types of advertising you can consider adding to your digital strategy: Social Media Advertising. Pay-Per-Click (PPC). Google Ads. Online Advertising. Nearly every platform has an option for you to advertise — either through a display network (such as Google’s) or through its built-in ad system (such as Instagram’s, Facebook’s, and LinkedIn’s self-serve advertising portal). Here’s one example of an ad on LinkedIn: Source What I like the most, and the biggest benefit of paid advertising, is that it’s not dependent on a content or SEO strategy where success can take a while to build. You choose a platform, create your budget, write copy, decide on images, and launch your advertising campaigns. Still, to ensure your success, I’d recommend creating an advertising plan that outlines who you’re targeting, which channels you’ll be using, and how much you plan to spend. I recommend 6. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) SEO is the practice of optimizing your web content, structure, and technical aspects to improve its visibility and ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs). The ultimate goal of SEO is to increase organic, non-paid traffic to your website from search engines like Google and Bing. If your product pages aren’t earning traffic, SEO is your best bet to get those pages in front of those who are searching for those products and services. To ensure that your content engages and converts users, it’s important to invest in an on-page SEO strategy. According to our survey, B2B brands report that the top marketing channel resulting in ROI in 2024 was website, blog, and SEO. I’m not surprised by this because of my own experience. More often than not, I’m looking to Google to find answers to my questions, and so are my other consumer peers — among all generations, people prefer to find answers to their questions with search engines. And, while social search (which I’ll cover below) continues to gain steam, consumers still find the best answers on search engines. AI chatbots, however, are gaining popularity — our 2025 survey named it as the top channel that brands are planning to use for the first time. Consider building up a solid presence in AI search results as soon as possible — before your competitors get ahead of the curve. An AI Search Grader lets you gauge your brand’s — and competitors’ — visibility across AI-powered search engines, along with popular search results related to your industry or company. You can use these details to gain more control over what type of information chatbots pull from your website, guide them to show accurate results, and create more relevant content. Online Marketing Benefits of SEO Increases organic traffic: Optimizing your digital content for search engines can help you rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs) for relevant keywords that your audience is using. As your ranking increases, so does your brand’s visibility and your website’s organic traffic. Improves user experience: When it comes to getting higher rankings, optimizing your website for users is just as important as optimizing for search engines. This includes ensuring that your website is easy to navigate and has a clear hierarchy of information so users can quickly find what they are looking for. In doing this, you not only improve the user experience, but you also increase the chances of users staying on your website longer, engaging with your brand, and ultimately, becoming customers. Provides long-term benefits: Unlike paid advertising, which requires ongoing investment, optimizing your content for search engines can provide long-term benefits by driving consistent and ongoing organic traffic to your website. Yes, it can take longer to reach your goals, but the payoff includes saving your business money and building an authentic brand reputation.

Podcasting In 2019, just 32% of Americans had listened to a podcast within the last month. In 2024, that jumped to 47% — that’s nearly half of American adults who have their headphones on and are looking for great audio content. Although it’s not as popular as some forms of content marketing, 13% of surveyed marketers told us that they were increasing their investment in podcasting in 2025. Dan Stillgoe, Blend’s Marketing Manager, spoke to my colleague Caroline Forsey and told her the same thing. He says, “It‘s true that you can’t directly attribute leads or revenue from a podcast, but that's not its purpose.\" Podcasts are a long-term brand-building channel that can improve affinity and connection for your brand like no other channel,“ he explains. ”When you realize the long-term and surrounding benefits, podcasting becomes a clear and obvious investment.” He adds, “Podcasting is the perfect way to craft content that's engaging and authentic — something buyers are beginning to crave in this AI era.” For inspiration, check out the HubSpot Podcast Network: Instead of looking to podcasts to drive exponential ROI, I recommend leveraging them to drive engagement. Having podcasts in your digital strategy allows you to reach people on platforms other than search engines and social media channels, and it’s a much more unplanned, natural medium — though, of course, you should plan each episode carefully and ensure you’re delivering contact that actually serves your listeners. As a consumer, I like the authenticity of podcasts and how they feel like a free-flowing conversation. I even pay for premium membership subscriptions to some of my favorite shows to take advantage of extra content. Featured Resource: How to Start a Podcast Online Marketing Benefits of Podcasting Discoverability: Podcasts can be hosted on various platforms, such as Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Stitcher, expanding your brand’s reach. You can also transcribe your podcasts and publish the transcript to make them more SEO-friendly. Plus, you can invite guests to speak on your podcast and have them share the episode with their followers. Authenticity: Podcasting allows for a more conversational tone compared to other forms of content. The audio format lends itself to authentic and unscripted conversations, creating a sense of connection and genuine interaction between you and your listeners. Sustainable: Podcasts have a long shelf life and can remain relevant for months to come, helping you get the most out of your content. Plus, you can repurpose the audio material to create blog posts, videos, ebooks, and other types of content.

Email Marketing Email marketing is still one of the most leveraged channels among marketers and offers the second-highest ROI for B2C brands. It gives you plenty of opportunity to nurture customers who are highly interested in your products. It’s important, however, to only email those who have opted-in to receive emails from you. It’s bad form — and illegal, for that matter — to do otherwise, and it risks diminishing your email deliverability. You can earn subscribers through your blog, contests, and even through webinars. Any time someone gives you their email — and every time they give consent to receive communication from you — you have full permission to target them with an email marketing campaign. Featured Resource: Email Marketing Planning Template Online Marketing Benefits of Email Marketing Builds relationships: Email allows you to communicate directly with your audience, establishing a personal relationship and building trust over time. You can also customize email campaigns to the interests and unique preferences of your target audience, providing more content that is relevant to their needs. Fun fact: Segmented and personalized emails drive 30% more opens and 50% more click-throughs. Drives traffic to your website: Emails with links to your website or blog can drive traffic to your website and engage with your brand. You can even send your email subscribers exclusive deals, promotions, or discounts, which can increase the potential for conversions. Easy to track: Email marketing campaigns can be tracked and measured, providing valuable insights such as open rates, click-through rates, conversion rates, bounce rates, and unsubscribe rates. By analyzing these metrics, you can make data-driven decisions that can help you reach your target audience more effectively. My pro tip: Streamline your email marketing efforts with generative AI, as marketers told us it’s the most effective at creating emails. Try it for yourself with AI Email Writer, HubSpot’s generative AI tool that will help you automate copywriting and create marketing emails that capture attention and inspire clicks.

Video Marketing With platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels on the rise, video marketing is more popular — and effective — than ever. Even with the will-they/won’t-they TikTok ban, 27.64% of surveyed marketers said they’re increasing their investments in the platform in 2025, only slightly trailing YouTube (29.58%) and Instagram (28.84%). One of the reasons videos are so effective is because they allow you to communicate with your audience in a more personal way. And with the aforementioned shift toward visual storytelling, it makes sense to put some resources behind video marketing, particularly if your target audience is on the younger side. Plus, short-form video takes less bandwidth and effort to create, you can still share a lot of information, and shorter videos align with the fast-paced attention span of many watchers. By making video an integral part of your digital strategy, you’re able to showcase your brand’s creativity and explore more content formats, such as product demos, explainer videos, expert interviews, customer testimonials, and more. Online Marketing Benefits of Video Marketing Boosts SEO: Since Google tends to prioritize video content in its search results, implementing video as part of your marketing strategy can improve your search engine visibility. Plus, video content can be optimized with relevant titles, descriptions, and keywords, making it easier for search engines to understand and categorize the content. Better retention: Video is easier to remember than text-based content because it allows you to use storytelling techniques and communicate important messages more effectively. Video has the power to invoke emotions and create a connection with your audience, making it easier for them to consume and remember your content. Enhances reach: Video is highly shareable on social media due to its easily digestible nature. As people share your video content with their own social media networks, it exposes your brand to new audiences.

Pre-Sectioned Template Completely Customizable Example Prompts Professionally DesignedDigital Marketing Strategy Template While a spreadsheet can be an efficient format for mapping your digital marketing strategy, that approach can quickly become messy and overwhelming. To plan your strategy for the long-term — typically between six to 12 months out, I recommend a reliable digital marketing strategy document. But where to start? With our free digital marketing plan template. This template will walk you through your business summary and initiatives, help you build your target market and competitor information, and flesh out your marketing strategy — including your budget and specific channels and metrics. Use this digital strategy template to build out your annual digital marketing strategy and tactics. By planning out these yearly plans, you can overlay when you and your team will be executing each action.

In July, you'll prepare for your biggest business month — what do you hope to have observed at this point that will influence the content you produce to support it? In September, you'll focus on earned media in the form of PR to drive additional traffic during the run-up. This approach provides a structured timeline for your activity which will help communicate plans among colleagues. Finally, here are some examples of digital marketing campaigns and their strategies to inspire you. Digital Marketing Campaign Examples 1. Béis: Paid Ad Travel accessory brand Béis ran a social media campaign to announce feature updates to one of its products. And they did it in the best way: by showing instead of telling. Why I like this: In a 34-second clip distributed on Instagram Stories, the brand shows how its product performed before and how it performs now after updating the material. This is a great campaign for a few reasons: It not only highlights product improvement but shows customers that the brand is committed to iterating and improving, It makes sure to include captions in the video so it's accessible to everyone, There’s a CTA button at the bottom of the screen that encourages customers to make a purchase. 2. Omsom: Social Media Asian food brand Omsom creates starter kits for home cooks who want a simple way to cook Asian cuisine without sacrificing authentic ingredients and flavors. The brand leverages its TikTok profile to share behind-the-scenes content, recipes, and culturally relevant content. In a recent video, the brand's co-founder shared how it sources one of its key ingredients and how it chose the more difficult route to preserve the integrity of the food. @weareomsom here's why we choose to make our lives harder as food founders! #business #sourcing ♬ original sound - Omsom Why I like this: Here’s what Omsom did right: Highlights its brand values while still building excitement around the product. Includes its website link in its TikTok bio. Offers a discount to customers who find it through the video-sharing platform. Sharing behind-the-scenes content is a great way to connect with your audience and share details that will simultaneously highlight your mission and/or values. 3. The General: Paid Advertising After reports that consumers thought the brand was untrustworthy due to its low-budget ads, The General decided to revamp its entire marketing strategy. In a commercial featuring basketball superstar Shaq, the brand addressed the elephant in the room and introduced a new and improved look. Why I like this: The General’s ad is a great example of effective crisis management. It addresses negative perceptions head-on, showing viewers that it's in tune with its target audience and their needs, It builds back credibility by emphasizing how long it’s been in business and the number of people it has helped.Digital Strategy Examples What makes a winning digital strategy? Let's peek behind the curtain at some of the best strategies from popular brands. 1. Fenty Beauty - Social Listening, Micro-Influencers, and Diversity Before the launch of Rihanna's makeup brand Fenty Beauty, there was a huge call for more diverse makeup options in the beauty industry. “I remember following different Black women and women of color who were makeup artists and influencers,” says HubSpot staff writer and social media expert Erica Santiago. “They would often echo the same problem my friends and I encountered when trying to find makeup, which was finding foundation and colors that complemented our skin.” When Rihanna launched Fenty Beauty in 2019, the brand consisted of 40 shades, more than most makeup brands at the time. Furthermore, the brand leveraged beauty influencers of various shades and backgrounds to promote the products. “It was clear the brand paid close attention to what makeup fans were saying online and what influencers people of color were following for beauty tips,” Santiago recalls. “I remember seeing prominent Black makeup influencers like Jackie Aina promoting the brand on Instagram.” Fast forward five years and Fenty Beauty still collaborates with a diverse lineup of beauty micro-influencers to show the wide range of Fenty Beauty shades and colors and how they look on consumers of different backgrounds. What I like: Fenty Beauty uses diverse micro- and nano-influencers to show the quality of their products and connect to consumers. Micro- and nano-influencers are known to have a close-knit community of followers, and leveraging this online helps Fenty build brand awareness. Lesson to Learn Use social listening. Pay close attention to what consumers in your industry are saying online and use that to inform the strategy and vision of your digital marketing campaign. Find an untapped niche. “Black women and WOC were a very underserved audience in the makeup and beauty industry, and still are in many ways,” Santiago says. “Fenty Beauty saw that and made a point to carve a lane with that audience and it's really helped them stand out as a brand.” 2. Nike — Apps, Games & the Metaverse Nike has impressed everyone with its digital strategies and innovative additions in recent years. First, they created apps like the Nike mobile app, SNKRS (for sneaker releases), Nike Training Club (NTC), and Nike Run Club (NRC). These apps helped Nike sell more stuff, especially during COVID-19. NTC, for example, saw an 80% sales jump in China in one quarter Source Nike is also exploring the metaverse with a place called Nikeland on Roblox. Young people are crazy about Roblox, with over 216 million monthly active users. Nike jumped on this trend and cleverly integrated its brand into this world. Nikeland sells digital clothes, shoes, and accessories for Roblox characters. They bought a company called RTFKT, which makes digital sneakers. People fell in love with these shoes, showing there's a big market for this stuff. Lessons to Learn Stay true to yourself. Don't lose sight of your mission. Use tech to help you achieve your goals, not just to make a quick buck. Make it personal. Speak to people in a way that resonates with them and personalize your digital offerings. Follow trends. Stay vigilant and in trend with what's currently popular and appealing to make the most out of every opportunity. 3. Hinge — The Power of Disruption and Antimarketing A popular dating app Hinge is doing something different than its competitors. They want people to stop using their app once they find love! This is a cool change from most apps that try to keep you using them all the time, like Tinder. That said, Hinge's message is “The dating app designed to be deleted.” Source Hinge uses specific prompts to help you create a meaningful profile that gets you closer to finding your soulmate, not just someone to go on a date with. These prompts are like conversation starters that help you show your true self and find someone who connects with you on a deeper level. For instance, here’s one of the prompts I’ve seen: “The one thing I'd like to know about you is…” You answer it, and those who resonate with your energy or share the same vibe will connect. Maybe one of them is “THE” person who will make you want to delete the app later. Who knows?Free Marketing Plan Template Outline your company's marketing strategy in one simple, coherent plan.

From generalist to content strategist and agency to enterprise, my role has changed a lot over the last (almost) eight years. And my professional bio has to keep up. Even though I can admit I don’t always feel like rewriting it. But we all know we have to keep our professional bios refreshed to give people an accurate snapshot of who we are, why they should work with us, and why they should care about what we have to say. For that reason alone (and because it’s my actual job), I’ll show you how to write a bio and share some of my favorite professional bio examples from years of reworking my own. Table of ContentsWhat is a professional bio?What should a professional bio say? How to Format Your Professional Bio First-Person Bio vs. Third-Person Bio Professional Bio Templates How to Write a Professional BioBest Professional Bio Examples Short Bio Tips, Samples, and Examples80+ Professional Bio Templates & Examples Create a compelling professional narrative for a proper, attention-grabbing introduction. LinkedIn Summaries Speaker Intros Website Bios Professional ProfileWhat is a professional bio? A professional bio or biography is a quick rundown of your background and experience. Your bio should include details about your professional expertise, skills, and achievements, but it’s also an opportunity to show off your personality and personal interests. They can live just about anywhere — your personal or company website, speaker or contributor pages, LinkedIn profile, or other social media channels. Purpose of Professional Bios “Writing a professional bio is more than just listing academic degrees or job titles — it's a strategic narrative about your professional journey,” says Rosario Maccarrone, Director & Head of Student Services at OPIT. It’s almost like an executive summary of your career. When I look at my own professional bio, I want it to answer four simple questions: Who is she? What has she done? What does she do? What can she do? I want someone to read it and think: “Wow, that was a great summary. I’d love to know more.” Your professional bio is your opportunity to briefly introduce yourself (or your brand) and tell clients, customers, employers, and colleagues what you’re good at. It’s not a laundry list of everything you’ve ever accomplished — you have a resume for that. The keyword here is snapshot. You want the reader to quickly identify what your areas of expertise, talents, and interests are. They can then use that snapshot to decide if they want to move forward and make a connection. Why Good Bios Are Important for Professionals But how many people actually read professional bios, anyway? Well, I can tell you that I tips, templates, and inspiring examples.How to Write a Short BioIntroduce yourself. State what you do. Add key skills or areas of expertise. Include a personal mission statement. Celebrate your wins. Provide your contact information. Make it fun.If you're posting a professional bio on a social media account or sending a quick blurb to a client, here’s how I’d approach keeping things short and sweet. 1. Introduce yourself. Your introduction is your first impression, so always begin by telling people who you are. I suggest starting with a greeting like, “Hi! I’m” or “Hello, my name is” to kick things off. Example: Hey there! I’m Alana Chinn. 2. State what you do. Next, give people an idea of what you do daily and where you work. As a blog editor who specializes in content for marketers, I’m always going to mention “Marketing Blog editor” somewhere. Example: I have over seven years of experience as a writer and marketer, and I’m currently the Marketing Blog editor at HubSpot. 3. Add key skills or areas of expertise. I’d also recommend highlighting your most valuable skills. I’m good at writing and keeping things organized, so I’ll be sure to include those details. Example: My attention to detail, writing, and organization skills keep the Blog running like a well-oiled content engine. 4. Include a personal mission statement. What do you hope to achieve through your work? Why do you do what you do? For shorter professional bios, I like to give a brief one-liner about what motivates me to do my best work. Example: When I’m not playing with my frenchie, I like to meet readers where they are with compelling messages that inspire career growth and spark great content ideas. 5. Celebrate your wins. Don’t forget to spotlight one to two major achievements — whether they're awards you won, publications you featured in, or companies you worked with. Example: In my first year as editor, I drove months of consecutive organic and YOY blog growth, with a YOY high of 36%. 6. Provide your contact information. Your professional bio is the first step toward building a relationship. Keep the connection alive by including your contact information for follow ups. Your email address, website, phone number or any other professional profiles are a good fit here. Example: Want to work together? Let’s connect on LinkedIn. 7. Make it fun. “Professional” doesn’t have to mean plain, so don’t be afraid to add a splash of charisma to your short professional bio. Try making a joke, mentioning a hobby, sharing a fun fact, or throwing in some emojis. Example: See “when I’m not playing with my frenchie“ above 😄 Here’s what it looks like when we put it all together: Hey there! I’m Alana Chinn. I have over seven years of experience as a writer and marketer, and I’m currently the Marketing Blog editor at HubSpot. When I’m not playing with my frenchie, I like to meet readers where they are with compelling messages that inspire career growth and spark great content ideas.

    "content": "I remember when ChatGPT first launched. The entire marketing community was split on whether they should use AI chatbots or not. Posts about ChatGPT would get hundreds of comments, with one side debating the convenience of AI and the other arguing that AI can never match human creativity.While the debate is still ongoing, AI chatbots are already everywhere. I’m seeing marketers relying on custom bots for social media, enterprises integrating voice assistants, and customer service teams scaling operations with AI. As someone who has worked in both automation and marketing, I’d say the shift to AI chatbots is here. And it’s here to stay. Marketers now have tons of solid chatbot options that can hold conversations almost as naturally as a human. In this post, I’ll walk you through the top 14 chatbots for marketers, how I tested them, and which ones you should consider for your marketing workflow. I’ll also give you the exact prompts I used and the results so you know what to expect. Table of Contents What is an AI chatbot?

Create chatbots in minutes Support customers 24/7 Qualify leads & book meetings And more!Get started freeWhat is an AI chatbot? An AI chatbot is a conversational program that uses machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to understand what you’re saying to it and give you human-like answers. It’s trained on a ton of data to understand patterns and word associations, allowing it to understand complex queries. Additionally, an AI chatbot learns from previous conversations, gradually improving its responses over time.Sounds like a lot? Let me break it down. Here’s what happens under the hood when you send a prompt to an AI chatbot: Input processing. Your prompt is broken down into tokens (words, phrases, or even parts of a word). Context mapping. The model tries to build relationships between words and their positions. This helps the model differentiate between “Sarah caught the bear” versus “The bear caught Sarah” — two very different problems to have. Self-attention. Now, it’s time to actually understand intent. The model identifies the key entities in your message and, based on previous training data, understands how they relate to each other. Response. The model starts forming the output options. This is a prediction system where the model predicts the next most likely word based on previous patterns. Feedback loop. As the final step, the chatbot runs the response candidates through different safety filters and quality controls. Each response is scored, and the best one is delivered as the output. All of this happens in the seconds/minutes you wait after sending the prompt. While I’ve described how a typical AI chatbot works, each model might implement the architecture differently. The end goal, though? Helping solve business (or personal) problems faster and more reliably. Conversational AI vs. Chatbots Chatbots and conversational AI are closely related, but differ in their scope and capabilities. Conversational AI refers to any technology that can talk to humans, understand sentiment, and answer questions. It can be a chatbot, AI agent, or other AI-generated application. AI chatbots are a subset of conversational AI, but not all chatbots use conversational AI. Some chatbots are purely rule-based, which rely on simple rules and decision trees to determine the best course of action. Rule-based chatbots can only handle specific, expected inputs. I’m sure you’ve interacted with many of them in the pre-ChatGPT era. Ask them something outside their script, and they’ll either give you a vague answer or redirect you to a human. In contrast, AI chatbots understand context and nuance, and are more capable of handling unexpected queries. If you want the user to choose between set options without much flexibility, opt for rule-based chatbots to save costs. However, if you want to deliver an upgraded user experience, I’d recommend choosing an AI chatbot. Why use AI chatbots? 4 Use Cases and Benefits of Chatbots for Marketers I’ve seen AI chatbots become significantly more intelligent over the last year. Earlier, you had to scrape and feed a ton of data to chatbots, and even then, the outputs were usable. Chatbots couldn’t even connect to the internet natively. However, with newer models and integration technologies like AI agents and MCP servers, the possibilities are endless. I recently connected my email to my Claude account via MCP. Now, I can get a handy summary of my day’s meetings and newsletter highlights with just a prompt. Here are some other ways businesses can use AI chatbots. Customer Support Provide 24/7 support to your customers with contextual answers. Faster ticket resolutions and close rates for straightforward cases. Escalate issues to the right stakeholder through intelligent workflow allocation. Sales and Marketing Automate sales prospecting and market research. Personalize automated outreach to your target audience at scale. Managing your sales pipeline by summarizing meetings, sending follow-up reminders, etc. Support customers through every stage of the buying journey by providing personalized and timely information. Writing and Editing Content strategy and ideation for blogs, emails, and social media posts. Deep research on specific topics to create article outlines. Brand-tailored first drafts for emails and social copy. Tweaking copy for certain audiences, platforms, and formats. Recruitment and HR Shortlist potential candidates based on resume strength. Answer common questions about open positions or company policies. Schedule interviews and meetings without endless back-and-forth emails. The examples here are just the tip of the iceberg. People have used chatbots for therapy, travel planning, ordering meals, and so much more. According to our State of AI report, 39% of marketers use chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot to create content and organize research. Thus, AI chatbots can: Save time, reduce employee burnout, and let them focus on strategic tasks instead of grunt work. Reduce the cost of labor and generate outputs faster. Conduct extensive data crunching and analysis more effectively. Help you scale your business without increasing headcount. Bottom line? You can easily customize AI chatbots to fit almost any organizational need. What makes an AI chatbot good? Here are some features I look for when experimenting with AI chatbots. Accuracy and Reliability AI chatbots are notorious for hallucinations, i.e, confidently making up misleading claims. According to HubSpot’s State of AI survey, 43% of marketers struggle with AI generating inaccurate information. I’ll admit, sometimes I get frustrated too. Some models perform better than others. For instance, reasoning models like OpenAI o3 and DeepSeek R1 reduce hallucination by showing you the steps they took to arrive at the conclusion. Models that are trained on domain-specific datasets are far more accurate in answering specialized questions. Pro tip: Introduce guardrails to your prompt and training data to reduce the chances of hallucinations. I generally include specific instructions like “don’t make up claims,” “give source links and mention the page number of the information,” and “if you are uncertain about a fact, just say so.” Regardless, you should always double-check what AI spits out. Emotional Intelligence Remember: We’re using chatbots to simplify user experience. So, a good AI chatbot should: Be able to understand user intent (and not get stuck with typos). Remember conversation context, or at the very least, document past interactions and refer to them when needed. Know when to escalate to a human agent. It should also be able to assess the tone and overall feeling of the customer’s inquiry. Is the customer: Angry? (“Why is my monthly payment increasing?!”) Sad? (“Please don’t discontinue your lavender chai latte chocolate! It’s my favorite flavor. I used to drink it with my dad before he passed.”) Happy? (“I love, love, LOVE the new sneaker designs! Please tell me they come in pink!”) The best chatbots I’ve used make me feel heard and understood. Types of Output Instead of just text responses, can your chatbot handle images and videos? With AI-generated content on the rise, this feature is a massive plus for chatbots. Imagine this: a customer asks, “How do I change this setting on your tool?” A normal chatbot would link the customer to the documentation or provide a text-based guide. However, a multimodal chatbot trained on your product can send annotated screenshots or even a video walkthrough. Less confusion, better user experience. Integrations As we move to an agentic era, I recommend choosing a chatbot that is compatible across other popular tools and software. For instance, your chatbot should be able to sync with your sales data, fetch the numbers, and spin up a dashboard to present them. HubSpot’s CRM is built for this connected workflow with seamless integrations across your tech stack, such as Claude, Zapier, and 1700+ business apps.Free AI Chatbot Builder Qualify leads, book meetings, provide customer support, and scale your one-to-one conversations — all with AI-powered chatbots. Create chatbots in minutes Support customers 24/7 Qualify leads & book meetings And more!Get started freeHow I Tested the Best AI-Powered Chatbots Most AI-powered chatbots have roughly the same value prop, i.e., answering user questions like a human would. However, I’ve found that some models excel at specific industries or tasks. If a model is exclusively trained for code generation (GitHub Copilot), it will naturally be better than an all-purpose chatbot like ChatGPT. Similarly, an AI chatbot trained on your CRM data would be able to handle product queries more accurately. Thus, I took a nuanced approach to testing these chatbots. I tested each tool with prompts that showcase its core strengths. I also added in some straightforward tasks here and there to help decide the best combination for your stack.The 14 Best AI ChatbotsBreeze ChatGPT Claude Grok Github Copilot Gemini DeepSeek Perplexity HubSpot Chatbot Builder Intercom Fin AI Agent Tidio Lyro Drift Zendesk AI Agents ChatbaseWith so many solid AI chatbot options on the market, it can be hard to decide where to start. To help you make an informed decision, I’ve compiled a list of the best AI chatbots based on their features, usability, and performance in testing. Whether you’re looking for a chatbot to support your business or improve personal productivity, there’s an option here for everyone. Note: I’ve divided this list into two parts. The first eight chatbots are focused on internal business and personal productivity use cases like generating ideas, content creation and more. Later, I’ll discuss consumer-facing chatbots. 1. Breeze Get Started with Breeze for Free Setting up a new chatbot is a very time-consuming process for me. It’s not just the initial training either. I need to continuously update it with new customer conversations and product features to get brand-aligned outputs. Breeze, HubSpot’s AI chatbot, helps you skip all of these setup steps. Breeze lives inside your CRM, so it has complete context about your customer journey, product features, sales pipeline, and more. It also integrates unstructured communication like emails and calls to external data, such as buyer intent and company news, to give Breeze the full picture. With hundreds of customer success stories, businesses using Breeze are seeing results across the board. HubSpot customers are already using it to: Close deals 56% faster Resolve 60% of customer queries automatically Increase content production by 250% Breeze delivers what marketers and businesses want: more qualified leads, faster sales cycles, customer retention, and satisfaction. How I Tested Breeze I tested Breeze through their “product demo” page. Honestly, I was expecting a video walkthrough and maybe a basic chatbot with standard responses. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The demo walked me through almost every bit of the chatbot’s AI capabilities, ranging from an AI avatar (Fiona) to intelligent demo recommendations. Of course, this experience set a very high bar for the tool. So, I set out to give it the first task: writing a follow-up email for prospects. The email I got back was quite good, despite the limited background information. I could directly ship it with some minor tweaks and personalization. Now, imagine this done at scale with real-time data, powered by your conversations, deal history, and customer experience. The possibilities are endless. Another thing I liked about the whole process was how responsive the chatbot was. She asked me intelligent yet natural-sounding questions to guide me through the sales process. If there was a lull in the conversation, she gently nudged me with casual questions. All of this showed how well the chatbot knew HubSpot’s offer, which is precisely the kind of product knowledge you’d want from an AI chatbot. Breeze Features I Liked Seamless HubSpot CRM integration. Combines both structured (CRM) and unstructured data (email) to power their intelligence software. Specialized agents for every marketing use case: content, social media, prospecting, and customer service. What I Didn’t Like The free demo didn’t let me test any advanced features. HubSpot-generated images are decent, but some of the chatbots on this list do a better job. Breeze Pricing Get started with basic AI features like content generation for free. HubSpot Starter ($15/seat/month, billed annually) - Starter marketing, sales, service, content, and operations software, with simple automation and Breeze intelligence. Professional Customer Platform ($1,300/month, includes 5 seats) - Includes customer agent functionality & 3,000 monthly HubSpot credits. Enterprise Customer Platform ($4,700/month, includes 7 seats) - Advanced Breeze features + 5,000 monthly HubSpot Credits. Note: You can unlock Breeze Intelligence only in the HubSpot Starter pack and Breeze Customer agent in the Professional plan. Credits can be used across HubSpot products, including Breeze. Why I Recommend Breeze If you’re a HubSpot user, Breeze serves as a natural extension of your existing tech stack. It’s the first AI assistant that knows your business as well as you do. While I wouldn’t recommend Breeze for media creation, you can use it to automate your daily marketing tasks. If you’re in the process of scaling your company, I’d highly recommend giving it a try. TL;DR: It’s a breeze to integrate HubSpot Breeze to your marketing workflows. 2. ChatGPT Launched in 2022 by OpenAI, ChatGPT made headlines as the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Fast forward to today, ChatGPT processes over 2.5B user queries per day. That’s roughly 1/3rd of Google’s 8.5B searches per day, making it a serious contender to traditional search. I’d give it a couple more years before using an AI chatbot like ChatGPT becomes muscle memory for users. So, what exactly are marketers asking ChatGPT? Well, a lot of things. The right GPT prompts can help you create brand-aligned content, polished images, crunch campaign numbers, and more. I use ChatGPT Plus for research, Excel analysis, and image generation. But that’s not all. The one GPT feature I’m most excited to test (but don’t have access to yet) is the ChatGPT agent. While chatbots typically wait to be prompted, agents can independently take and act on decisions. For instance, if I want the GPT agent to purchase a pair of socks for me at the cheapest price, the agent can compare different sites, test out coupon codes, and then share the results with me. I’m already seeing GPT agent use cases implemented across social media, so I can’t wait for a broader rollout. As of this writing, the ChatGPT agent is only available to Pro users. How I Tested ChatGPT Let’s start with a simple prompt. I was working with a client in the project management niche, who wanted a report on how they stack up against competitors. So, I decided to use ChatGPT to augment my research. For each competitor, I prompted it to draw up a SWOT analysis and identify winning features that my current client did not have. The SWOT analysis was pretty helpful. Next, I wanted to test GPT for image generation. Here, I went slightly goofy, asking GPT to generate a cat image with a sign. ChatGPT did a great job of adhering to my unusual request. ChatGPT Features I Liked ChatGPT agent. Automate complex, multi-step workflows. Custom GPT. Build a specialized chatbot with custom instructions, or use one from their library of GPTs trained on social media, legal, data science, and many domains. Image generation. I use Sora, ChatGPT’s built-in image generation model, to generate design references and edit existing images. Deep research. I find GPT’s deep research mode quite helpful for complex research, especially historical research. What I Didn’t Like Image generation takes quite a bit of time and sometimes doesn’t work very well for human features and text. ChatGPT agent throws errors while navigating websites if it doesn’t load quickly enough. ChatGPT Pricing Free users get access to GPT 4.1 with unlimited usage and limited usage of advanced models. Plus users ($20/month) include ChatGPT agents, Sora video generation, and research access to new models. Pro users ($200/month) get extended limits on everything in Plus and access to o3-pro and the Codex agent.Free AI Chatbot Builder Qualify leads, book meetings, provide customer support, and scale your one-to-one conversations — all with AI-powered chatbots. Create chatbots in minutes Support customers 24/7 Qualify leads & book meetings And more!Get started free3. Claude As a writer, I’m quite partial to Claude. Claude is an excellent creative thinker, and when I give it enough context, it can emulate brand voices very well. I heavily depend on Claude for content strategy, first drafts, and editing sentences. For each new client, I typically set up a new project and provide it with documents like brand guidelines, podcasts, etc, as context. This is similar to the CustomGPT feature by ChatGPT. However, since Claude has a larger context window, the model produces better outputs. I also love Claude’s MCP feature. Like I mentioned earlier, I used it to sync my email to the AI assistant, which I’ll show you below. You can also connect to a variety of other tools such as Asana (project management), Canva (graphic design), and more. P.S.: HubSpot recently released a MCP connector for Claude, which I’m super excited about. How I Tested Claude Let’s start with the research test. I usually like to start my week by reading up on trending AI news so I can think of content ideas around them. So, I prompted Claude to give me a summarized version, pulling information from my newsletter subscriptions plus additional web research on its own. Here’s the prompt I ran: “Can you give me a summary of the AI news highlights from the last week? Access my newsletter subscriptions via my email to pull information from. Also, conduct independent research to find any other important news. Present this in a tabular format, with headline, short blurb, and if you think any can be made in social media content pieces.” Well, color me impressed. While the first item was from July 17th (outside the request timeframe), Claude did a fair job of collating recent AI news. The content ideas weren’t too great, but I’ve gotten much better results when I give Claude context about my client and goals. I especially liked how the information was presented — organized and easy to scan. And that’s something I find in other Claude features too. For instance, here’s how I used Claude to iterate on a landing page for my clients. It was helpful to see how my copy looks in a design mockup. I can spot issues, tweak my copy and optimize for production faster. Claude Features I Liked Writing quality. Out of all AI chatbots I’ve tried, Claude produces the most on-brand and natural content. Projects. I use projects for organizing conversations and documents. Integrations. Claude is now rolling out MCP connectors for most major apps. Emphasis on privacy. Anthropic, Claude’s parent company, uses a proprietary algorithm called Clio to anonymize user conversations for training. What I Didn’t Like Claude has strict usage limits. If you’re using advanced features like artifacts, research, etc., you’re going to hit your limit fast. No image or video generation features. Claude Pricing Free tier - Limited access to top models. Pro tier - ($17/month/user, billed annually) - Unlocks higher message limits, projects, Claude Code, integrations, and more. Max tier - (from $100/month/user, billed annually) - 5-20x higher usage than Pro, early and priority access to new features. 4. Grok Have you ever doomscrolled for hours in the name of “content research”? I know I have. So, when X rolled out its native AI chatbot, Grok, I knew I had to try it. While other chatbots have limited access to social media (anti-scraping laws), Grok can tap into X’s live field to monitor trends and analyze other accounts. I frequently use Grok’s “explain this post” feature — it’s a handy way to get context on things I’m clueless about without leaving the platform. You can also tag @grok in tweets to fact-check the accuracy of information. How I Tested Grok For the first part of the test, I asked Grok to analyze the top tweets about AI agents in the past month. The output was a high-level overview of the key themes in trending posts. I could easily verify the source and authenticity of the tweets by following the linked handles. Next, I turned on the “DeepSearch” feature. DeepSearch is ideal for any task that needs heavy research and analysis. For this test, I asked Grok to analyze the handle of a popular X influencer in the AI niche. Based on its analysis, I also prompted it to develop a content strategy for an influencer who wants to achieve similar success. Upon running the prompt, Grok walked me through its exact process of how it tackled my request. This was a nice touch and gave me ideas for my own research process. Grok’s social audit was one of the best I’ve seen from AI tools, matching the quality of professional audits. The analysis gave me everything I needed to know: recent + viral posts, engagement rates, posting frequency, presence on other platforms, audience frequency, and more. I especially liked the neat comparative table at the end of the audit. Perfect base to build out a content strategy from. I’d give the entire experience a solid 8/10. Grok Features I Liked Grok is useful for high-quality social media audits, analysis, and real-time sentiment gauging. Native X features like “Explain this post,” replies through tags, and data analysis make Grok useful for heavy X users. Grok is designed to have a refreshing sense of humor (a by-product of being trained on social media, I suppose). What I Didn’t Like Grok doesn’t have a thriving developer community yet, so third-party integrations are limited. No video generation capabilities. Real-time data can also lead to misinformation. Grok Pricing Free access to Grok 3 for all X users. X Premium ($7/month, billed annually) - Unlocks advanced Grok limits, boosted X performance,etc. X Premium+ ($32.92/month, billed annually) - Faster access to newer features and ad-free experience. SuperGrok Heavy ($300/month) - Access to Grok’s most advanced models. 5. Github Copilot At my previous job as a software engineer, I spent hours trying to learn a new coding framework. Sometimes, my code wouldn’t work because of a tiny error right under my nose. I’d hunt Stack Overflow’s scattered threads for answers, stress-testing them till I find the one that works. Github CoPilot would have been a lifesaver back then. With over 20M users, Github Copilot helps developers code up to 55% faster. You can generate code files on Copilot, create mockups, and debug your code on the extension or platform. Copilot syncs with all major code editors, such as VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains etc., so you can use an extension to access it within your favorite IDEs. How I Tested Github Copilot I started with a fairly simple ask: Build me a tic-tac-toe game with an AI playing against me. While I asked for a tic-tac-toe game, Copilot correctly identified that I was describing the mechanics of a ping pong game. Copilot: 1, Lipsa: 0. Copilot generated three files: HTML for the canvas, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game mechanics. I ported the files over to an online code editor, CodePen, and the game worked quite well. Github Copilot Features I Liked Instant multi-language code generation for a variety of use cases, from games to dashboards. Suggests the ideal way to implement or visualise the code. Shows logical thinking and doesn’t follow instructions blindly. What I Didn’t Like Copilot occasionally produces incorrect or unoptimized code. GitHub Copilot cannot generate images or visual mockups of generated code. Github Copilot Pricing Get started for free. 50 chat requests + 2,000 code completions. Pro ($10/month) - Unlimited agent mode & code completions. Pro+ ($39/month) - Access to premium AI models and GitHub Spark, a prompt-based app builder.Free AI Chatbot Builder Qualify leads, book meetings, provide customer support, and scale your one-to-one conversations — all with AI-powered chatbots. Create chatbots in minutes Support customers 24/7 Qualify leads & book meetings And more!Get started free6. Gemini Gemini is a great assistant. Due to its native integrations across Google products like Workspace and Pixel phones, I can use it on the go. I currently use Gemini for tasks like creating calendar tasks with one prompt, drafting Gmail replies, Google Meet summaries/notes, and more. Gemini models are also quite powerful for advanced reasoning, mathematics, and complex tasks. Fun fact: Gemini with Deepthink now has a gold medal at the International Math Olympiad. How I Tested Gemini While I was trying to find something to test Gemini with, I was pleasantly surprised to see a Gemini-powered summary across my documents on Google Drive. They say the best experiments are the ones you stumble upon, and Gemini definitely delivered on this one. Next, I wanted to test Gemini’s video generation capabilities with Veo-3. My prompt was not the best, but the model produced a great 5-second video. The White House was instantly recognizable, and the man’s features and movements were also quite natural. You would definitely need multiple iterations for more complex videos with layers and scenes. However, this should give you a fair glimpse of what the model can achieve. So, my final verdict on Gemini? I’d say go for it if you use Google’s ecosystem heavily. You’ll be faster and more productive across your daily apps. Gemini Features I Liked Native integration across all Google products. Advanced document analysis and research capabilities. You can generate text, audio, and video in a single interface. What I Didn’t Like Gemini takes a while to generate both images and videos. Since Veo-3 isn’t natively available in my country, I had to use a VPN to access it. Gemini Pricing Get started for free. Gemini Advanced ($19.99/month) - Unlocks access to Veo-3, AI-powered docs, 2 TB of storage, and NotebookLM plus. 7. DeepSeek As China’s top LLM model, DeepSeek is widely regarded as a ChatGPT competitor. Shortly after its release in Jan 2025, DeepSeek’s AI assistant app surpassed ChatGPT as the top free app on the Apple App Store (US). While the initial momentum was short-lived, DeepSeek’s models have a good value prop: cheap AI + good reasoning capabilities. At launch, DeepSeek’s capabilities were comparable to ChatGPT, while being 90% cheaper. Let’s see if that still holds true. How I Tested DeepSeek When I tested DeepSeek, I focused on research-heavy tasks. I started with a code generation prompt to create a form, connect it to a sheet, and then auto-filter responses based on specific criteria. The model took about ~30 seconds to generate code I could use. I exported the code to my Apps Script file, and it worked without a hitch. Now, let’s test DeepSeek’s research capabilities using DeepThink R1. My prompt was to compare and contrast other AI chatbots. Given DeepSeek has a censorship issue, I was curious to see what it would say about its competitors. I liked how DeepSeek first considered the audience before diving into individual tools. That’s exactly how I would approach researching an article. The output was well-formatted, with the key takeaways in a structured table. If you’re looking for a fast and efficient model for non-sensitive research data tasks, DeepSeek seems to be a good bet. DeepSeek Features I Liked Open-source model licensed under MIT. It supports commercial use cases plus modifications to the base model. Most cost-efficient model on this list; up to 1/30th cheaper than similar OpenAI models. Excels at deep reasoning tasks. What I Didn’t Like DeepSeek’s data privacy policies are questionable, especially with China’s mandate for companies to share data with the government. Censorship concerns. No image or video generation. DeepSeek Pricing DeepSeek chat is free. API-based access for DeepSeek Chat (per 1M tokens) - $0.07 (input), $1.10 (output). API-based access for DeepSeek Reasoner (per 1M tokens) - $0.14 (input), $2.19 (output). DeepSeek also runs discounted rates (up to 50%) for periods of downtime (UTC 16:30-00:30, at the time of writing). 8. Perplexity Want to access and test a lot of different models in one tool? Perplexity offers exactly that. The free version of Perplexity is an AI-powered search engine using a combination of Claude and OpenAI’s GPT model in the backend. With my Pro subscription, I can switch between the latest models like GPT 4.1, Claude 4.0 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and more. All of this makes Perplexity a great research assistant. I primarily use it to spot trends and research on the go. One of my favorite aspects of the tool is the newsfeed below; it does a great job of recommending articles I’d actually want to read. How I Tested Perplexity I first tested Perplexity for trend analysis. More specifically, the top B2B SaaS trends for 2025. While I quite like how the information is presented and segregated in different tabs, the trends themselves were basic. I’ve gotten better results with GPT-4-o on a prompt like this. However, I did like the follow-up question suggestions. Next up: Let’s build out a dashboard on the economic impact of U.S. tariffs using Perplexity Labs, a pro feature. Within minutes, I had a fully functional working website, with charts that drew up correlations between the most critical variables. The level of detail was impressive. I could access all of the individual charts directly from the “Assets” tab or create a shareable link for others. Perplexity Features I Liked Research using top models like Claude 4.1, GPT-4 etc. Citations and sources on all data and statistics, making it easy to cross-verify information. AI-generated research feed for personalized recommendations. Great visualization capabilities with Perplexity Pro. What I Didn’t Like Advanced features like Perplexity labs have a slight learning curve. Integrations to popular apps like Excel haven’t been built out yet. Perplexity Pricing Free tier - Use the Sonar model for unlimited quick searches and 5 pro searches per day. Student Pro tier ($4.99/month) - Unlock Perplexity Labs, research, premium AI models, and API credits. Max tier ($200/month) - Early access to Comet browser and unlimited Perplexity Labs + Research. Enterprise Pro ($33.33/user/month, billed annually) - Unlimited pro searches, collaborators, and dedicated enterprise support. 9. HubSpot Chatbot Builder Free Chatbot Builder Software If you want a chatbot builder trained on your CRM data, look no further than HubSpot’s chatbot builder. With HubSpot Chatbot builder, you can design custom sequences for specific customers, send personalized messages, and lighten the load for your support team. Having seen support teams burn out from repetitive questions, I was curious to see how much HubSpot’s Chatbot builder takes off their plate. Note: While HubSpot’s chat builder software is a rule-based chatbot, you can customize it through code snippets and use powerful third-party AI bots like Dialogflow. How I Tested HubSpot Chatbot Builder I found HubSpot’s Chatbot Builder quite intuitive. The drag-and-drop interface made it simple to build out specialized chatbots. Here’s an example of a lead-qualifying bot. You can use this bot to handle the bulk of your customer questions and pre-qualify by asking targeted questions. This helps your sales team save time on initial screening and put their energy where it matters. The best part? Each lead will be documented in your CRM seamlessly. If a lead already exists within your CRM, the bot will send personalized messages based on their last interaction. For instance, if I last followed up with a lead a week back, it’ll reference that interaction and naturally continue the conversation. More opportunities, fewer leads slipping through the cracks. So, while this tool isn’t strictly AI-powered, you can use it to build out custom chatbots for simple use cases quickly. HubSpot Chatbot Builder Features I Liked Seamless drag and drop interface to create chatbots quickly without coding. Integrated with HubSpot’s CRM to store customer data and trigger email campaigns. No learning curve, easy templates, and intuitive experience. What I Didn’t Like Rule-based chatbots aren’t very customizable. Can’t handle complex use cases. HubSpot Chatbot Builder Pricing Free software. 10. Intercom Fin AI agent Intercom is a leader in the customer support space, and its AI chatbot, Fin is no exception. Fin AI agent uses a mix of top AI models, such as GPT-4 and Claude, to deliver a truly conversational AI chatbot. I first came across this tool through Anthropic’s case study, where Fin AI agent delivers average resolution rates of 51% across their customer base. These numbers are quite impressive, so I decided to dig deeper. Fin AI agent allows you to sync content from a variety of sources, such as your website, Zendesk, conversations, documents, and more. You can then train the AI bot rigorously by batch-testing live conversations, rating its answers, testing different audiences, and more. While this setup might need more time and resources, it will help your customer service team become more efficient in the long run. You can also set up tasks, custom instructions, and more. How I Tested Intercom Fin AI Agent While I wasn’t able to fully test Fin AI agent because of its enterprise set-up, I spoke to Amrita Bhasin from Sotira, an AI retail company. She uses Intercom for website signups and customer qualification. She told me that, “the most unique use case [for our chatbots] is purchasing and extracting information about what SKUs/inventory are available so customers can essentially purchase via the chatbot, so every step of the way is guided; this almost feels like in store personalized purchasing for customers. \" I also signed up for the Fin AI agent trial to show you what the backend ticketing system looks like. Intercom Fin AI Agent Features I Liked Easy-to-use interface and a clean ticket management system. Integrated batch testing capabilities and answer ratings. One-click deployment across email, voice, live chat, social, and more. What I Didn’t Like Vendor lock-in - You need to migrate your entire stack to Intercom and recreate any alternate workflows from scratch. Intercom’s features can feel slightly overwhelming for smaller teams. Intercom Fin AI Agent Pricing Essential ($29/seat/month, billed annually) - Fin AI agent, Messenger, basic inbox and ticketing system. Advanced ($85/seat/month, billed annually) - Advanced automation like workflows, workforce allocation and 20 Lite seats. Expert ($132/seat/month) - SLAs, HIPAA compliance, and more. Fin AI agent has an outcome-based pricing ($0.99 per resolution) with a minimum of 50 resolutions per month. 11. Tidio Lyro Tidio Lyro is a conversational AI chatbot built for small and medium businesses. Lyro’s value prop is simple: Answer customer queries instantly based on your support content. If it can’t answer a question, it hands off the conversation to a human agent. I spoke to businesses that have integrated Tidio Lyro, and they were generally happy about Tidio’s performance. However, I noticed that companies that didn’t have extensive documentation or support saw higher escalation rates to human agents. How I Tested Tidio Lyro Signing up for Tidio Lyro’s AI agent was a straightforward process. After signing up, I filled out some onboarding questions and was then redirected to a quick integration tutorial. Here, I can train Tidio on my common sales, leads, and support flows to automate repetitive conversations. Lyro can even recommend products to bottom-of-the-funnel buyers when appropriate. Oleh Stupak from Mgroup, who uses Tidio for lead qualification, told me: “Although handling FAQs was the original goal, we discovered [Tidio’s] true power lies in automatically qualifying leads and sending them to the appropriate Shopify specialist.” Here’s how their Tidio-powered chatbot looks: Lyro Features I Liked Learns from your company data and support documents to answer customer questions. Fast response times with reasonable accuracy. Built-in human hand-off system. What I Didn’t Like It can take too long to load sometimes. Pricing is multi-tiered and a bit complex. Heavily dependent on your documentation. Lyro Pricing Flows (Starts at $24.17/mo) - Unlocks access to intelligent response handling. 2,000 visitors cap. Lyro AI Agent (Starts at $32.50/month) - Includes personalized on-brand messages, knowledge-based responses, and human handoff. 50 Lyra AI conversations included.Free AI Chatbot Builder Qualify leads, book meetings, provide customer support, and scale your one-to-one conversations — all with AI-powered chatbots. Create chatbots in minutes Support customers 24/7 Qualify leads & book meetings And more!Get started free12. Drift Drift has become quite popular since its February 2024 acquisition by Salesloft. It specializes in supporting B2B sales teams through AI, by directly integrating into Salesloft’s Revenue Orchestration Platform. I consider it the ultimate one-two punch for managing the buyer journey — from the first interaction to closing the deal. Drift still shines at what it does best: engaging site visitors based on their behavior, answering questions, booking meetings, and qualifying leads. But now, with new features like Drift Engage, Fastlane, and Bionic Chatbots, it's much better at delivering fast, personalized customer experiences. How I Tested Drift I explored how businesses are using Drift in action. For example, the Site Concierge feature acts like a digital host, greeting visitors, answering their questions, and pointing them in the right direction, all in real time. One thing that caught my attention was how Drift Engage helps sales teams tailor conversations based on visitors’ browsing behavior and previous chats. It’s like having an AI-powered assistant on your website, ready to qualify leads or book meetings on the spot. Drift Features I Liked Trained on 100 million B2B conversations to detect sales intent accurately and route to the right team member. AI-driven buyer qualification to identify prospects most likely to convert based on behavior patterns. Dedicated chat experiences for campaigns. Personalizes messages based on visitor's company, industry, and engagement history. What I Didn’t Like High entry barrier, making Drift suitable to only well-funded organizations. Has a significant learning curve, which requires technical expertise. Drift Pricing On-demand. 13. Zendesk AI Agents I’ve been using Zendesk for a couple of years now to manage support tickets for my clients. Having moved from the chaotic ticketing system of Discord, I find Zendesk to be quite efficient at organizing and managing conversations. Integrating Zendesk’s AI chatbot into my workflow was an obvious next step. Zendesk has years of real support conversations (19 billion of them!) to train the model on, so its answers are more human-like. How I Tested Zendesk AI Agents Here’s what Zendesk’s ticketing system looks like: You get a handy dashboard where you can invite team members, set auto responses, and reply to tickets directly. Zendesk’s built-in assistant, Copilot, automatically categorizes the ticket intent, language, and sentiment. I can also use Copilot’s AI generated responses to reply to tickets. Source Now, let’s go to the AI agents part. Zendesk agents can be activated via the Admin control panel in settings. I clicked on Create AI agent, and set the name and tone for my agent.Then, it prompted me to select the brand I want to train the AI on. Remember, for this to work effectively, you need a repository of helpdesk content your AI agent can fetch responses from. Zendesk Features I Liked Enterprise-grade ticket management solution. Workforce management, resource allocation, and AI-powered contact centers all in one tool. Robust track record in support. What I Didn’t Like Zendesk’s agents have pre-set tones, and there’s not much room for customization. Zendesk Pricing Support Team ($19/agent/month, billed annually) - Basic email based ticketing, Facebook/X support, automations, and analytics. Suite Team ($55/agent/month, billed annually) - Unlocks access to AI agents, live chat and phone support. Suite Professional ($115/agent/month, billed annually) - 5+ help centers, legal compliances like HIPAA, intelligent escalations and more. Suite Enterprise ($169/agent/month, billed annually) - 300+ help centers, sandbox environment, audit logs, and more. You also have outcome-based pricing for agents as an add-on with $1.50+ per successful resolution (volume discounts available). 14. Chatbase Chatbase is an AI chatbot builder designed to spin up customer support agents trained on your data. This tool is similar to Tidio Lyro and Zendesk, with a built-in human hand-off system. Two things that stood out to me in this tool were its AI agent testing playground and the ability to configure actions. With actions, your chatbot can handle real-world tasks such as setting meetings, triggering notifications, searching the web, and more. How I Tested Chatbase First, I created a new AI agent by configuring my workspace and providing it with training data. Then, I navigated to the Playground to test it. In this test environment, I could easily try out different models, tones, and actions until I find the right tone and depth for my bot. You can also set system prompts to act as certain roles (sales agents, language tutor, etc.) and custom instructions. For instance, in the image above, I asked it to act as a sales agent. While it pulled information from my documentation, the answer wasn’t very personalized to my question. Chatbase Features I Liked Easily build chatbots trained on your customer data with their no-code interface. Test environment to fine-tune agent responses and experiment with different models. Solid analytics dashboard. What I Didn’t Like Answers are heavily reliant on your provided documentation and lack personalization. While AI actions are a useful concept, the plan limits are quite restrictive. Chatbase Pricing Free Plan - 100 message credits/month, one AI agent (bot deleted after 14 days of inactivity). Hobby Plan ($40/month) - 2,000 message credits, one AI agent, 5 actions/agent. Standard Plan ($150/month) - 12,000 message credits, two AI agents, 10 actions/agent. Pro Plan ($500/month) - 40,000 message credits, three AI agents, 15 actions/agent. What I Learned About AI Chatbots From This Experiment I’ve come a long way from getting frustrated at customer service chatbots to embracing them as a powerful business tool. Don’t get me wrong — I still get frustrated with the chatbot responses sometimes. However, it’s hard not to be impressed when I can generate good content ideas, draft content, or even create decent graphics in minutes. If I had to pick my favorite chatbots from this list, it’d be Breeze (for end-to-end business automation), Claude (for personal use), and Tidio (for building customer-facing chatbots). However, I know many friends who would swear by ChatGPT’s custom GPTs. My advice? Use my tests as a reference, select the top chatbots for your stack, and try them. Each business has unique needs, and while I’ve decided my favorites after intense testing, newer features might make me switch.

    "title": "The future of marketing isn’t humans vs. AI — it’s humans with AI",
    "content": "Small business owners are all saying the same thing: “My website traffic is tanking, and the stuff that used to work just doesn‘t anymore.” And they’re right. Nearly 60% of searches don’t end in a click — people are getting answers from AI and never visiting your site. But here‘s what’s crazy: The same AI that‘s killing your traffic? It’s also your best opportunity to leapfrog the competition. If you’re like most marketers, you’ve read the subreddits and you know it‘s been pretty bleak. Traffic’s going down, and the same amount of work is getting worse results. HubSpot surveyed more than 500 marketers, and they feel the same way. Customers are wondering, “How do we do marketing when AI is consuming our traffic?” So you’re a business owner, your traffic’s down the drain, and you’re wondering, “What the heck do I do?” If you’re curious and willing to take action, this is the best time ever to be a small business. You have tools at your fingertips that used to require expensive agency contracts. You just need a blueprint on how to use them. HubSpot is calling this new growth playbook Loop Marketing, and anyone can use it. At the center of this guide is a new kind of partnership that combines AI efficiency with human authenticity to drive growth to your business. HubSpot has given the Loop an extensive test drive. It works. Let’s dive into the four steps of implementing this playbook in your business. They are: Express, Tailor, Amplify, and Evolve. Express: Tell Your Story Like a Human, Scale It Like a Machine The first thing you want to do is express who you are — define your taste, tone, and point of view before you bring in AI. A lot of businesses are missing this crucial step. HubSpot research shows that nearly 6 in 10 don’t actually have their unique value proposition documented. Look at these numbers — that’s a lot of people who don’t have a clear idea on their company’s brand story. Worse, an overwhelming majority of the respondents in this survey, just over three-quarters, said that teams without a clear value prop “moderately to highly” miss their goals. That’s tough for morale and for your bottom line. What a lot of those teams may not realize is how a relatively inexpensive AI tool and a few good prompts can help address these snags — in minutes, not months. Everyone has access to the same AI tools, but what’s different about the Loop playbook is you. AI needs the context and perspectives about your business that only you can give it. So use an AI tool — whether that’s Claude, ChatGPT, Breeze or something else that works for you — to help you create a brand style guide and to give you a simulation of customer feedback. This amounts to businesses being able to do their own market research with agency-quality personas — this would have been totally out of reach for many businesses until very recently. One way to simulate customer feedback is with a Claude project that has all the information about your target customer. You can ask it questions about marketing campaigns you’re doing and get real-time feedback on how to make them better. This is called the Express stage in our new Loop Marketing playbook. Basically: Only you can define your brand story, but AI can take that story and give you the kind of customer feedback that used to require expensive focus groups. Tailor: Make Every Customer Feel Like Your Only Customer The next step is using AI to tailor the story to your target audience. You might be thinking, “I can already send emails to Dear {First Name}” — but you can do a whole lot better now. The history of marketing has largely been about who can make the best educated guesses possible — you find some commonality among people, guess what they want, and try to give them what you think they want. The remarkable thing about AI is that instead of making guesses about a group of tens of thousands of people, you can instead guess what‘s most relevant to this one person. And with an AI engine that knows your business, where you’re located, who your customers are, what they’re looking for, and which ones are showing intent to buy — well, you’re going to get some pretty good guesses. It's not just Dear {First Name} anymore. Imagine you run a local coffee shop and your emails have coffee puns that are specific to your individual customers. You can't create personalization tokens for puns, right? But AI can do that. There’s a common misconception out there that using AI will make your business sound generic. But it’s really about the data you give it. For example, the HubSpot marketing team has seen conversion rates improve 82% using AI-driven personalization. This is called the Tailor stage of Loop Marketing — think of it like getting a custom suit instead of buying one off the rack. Custom tailoring used to be a luxury, but now AI has gotten to the point where it’s within reach of even small budgets. Amplify: Find Customers Where They Actually Are Next, you need to amplify to meet customers where they are. This means caring how your business shows up in AI engines like ChatGPT or Perplexity — your customers aren’t clicking through from Google searches anymore. So you’re seeing a lot of traffic diminishing all over the internet. This is where it gets interesting, because the people who do find their way to your website are higher-quality leads than ever before. Think about it like a consumer: Everyone has the same amount of research at their fingertips. It’s pure information symmetry. So if someone is looking to buy a new sofa, they can do a ton of research before landing on the website of the furniture company they’ll actually buy from. This is called the Amplify stage of Loop Marketing, getting your message out into this new AI-driven world and getting high-quality prospects in return. Start with AEO, or AI Engine Optimization. It’s the next evolution of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and it’s going to transform the way your company’s message is distributed. SEO is about ranking in the top five links; AEO is about being part of the answer. There are lots of great options out there to help you get cited and recommended by those AI engines; pick one and start building on whatever visibility you already have. And look, it’s not just about search traffic. Most marketers are spending more on events in 2025 than they did in 2024 — people are craving human interaction again. And it’s the best time yet to work with influencers, who can be that trusted person to give real-life recommendations about your business. The ROI is just tremendous: Companies like HubSpot are seeing far lower cost per lead with influencers compared to the big programmatic channels like Google and Facebook. When AI is doing all this customization and amplification for you, you’ve got more money and energy to invest into other channels that are really, really working for you. Evolve: Every Campaign Makes Your Next One Even Better Here‘s what’s really cool about the Loop Marketing playbook: Every time you run through this loop, you get better. Your marketing compounds. You're constantly improving, constantly learning, and your results just keep getting better and better. That’s why this is called the Evolve stage of Loop Marketing. The old way, in comparison, was brutal. You’d run a campaign for weeks or even longer, and then do a big post-mortem analysis. It probably involved a lot of meetings that should have been emails. But now you can ask AI in natural language and get immediate insights: “How should I adjust my targeting? What message resonated the most?” Making adjustments in real time means more successful and more cost-effective campaigns. AI is ready. Are you? The most common resistance to AI is fear — fear that AI will replace you or devalue your skills. But the future of marketing isn’t humans versus AI — it’s humans with AI. Businesses just need a guide to help them figure out how to make this human-AI collaboration work. That’s where the Loop can help. When a big shift in technology happens, it creates massive opportunities for marketers. This was evident with early Facebook and early Google — so much money was made during those times. People aren't seeing that same opportunity today because this shift represents a loss of control. Nobody is used to that. But this shift is even bigger now than it was then, and marketers who are using tools like the Loop Marketing playbook and taking advantage of this moment in AI are going to see their growth compound, and fast. If you’re willing to take action in the next 18 months, it’s going to be impossible not to succeed — the opportunities are just that big.HubSpot's Loop Marketing Prompt Library Loop Marketing is a new way to grow — powered by humans and AI, working together to express your message, tailor it to your audience, amplify it across channels, and evolve it in real time.

    "title": "How I Repost on Instagram: Ways to Reshare Content From Other Users",
    "content": "I know that Instagram is primarily about sharing striking visuals — images, videos, promotions, and even acting as a storefront for one’s business. But in truth, I spend much more time reposting other people’s content than my own. Sure, Instagram is a powerful social media tool that can help me increase my brand’s reach and attract new business. However, it’s also time-consuming and can be expensive to maintain the volume of original content needed to keep engagement growing long-term — which is exactly why I learned how to repost on Instagram. In this post, I’ll walk you through a few simple, free ways to repost on Instagram. But before diving in, let me explain why and how reposting can benefit your brand. Table of ContentsWhy should your brand repost on Instagram? How to Repost on Instagram How to Repost on Instagram Using a Screenshot What to Know Before Reposting on Instagram Resharing on Instagram Best Practices Best Apps for Reposting on Instagram FAQs About Reposting on InstagramWhy should your brand repost on Instagram? Instagram is one of the largest social media sites on the market. With over two billion monthly active users, brands that incorporate the site into their marketing strategy can reach larger audiences and gain visibility faster over other social media channels. And with an audience like that, you want to consistently post high-quality content — but that can take time, effort, and resources that may not fit your bud TemplatesHow to Repost on Instagram Instagram allows you to repost other users’ Reels and posts to your own Instagram Story using its native reposting functionality. However, it has its limits: It doesn’t let you repost to any permanent part of your Instagram profile, including your feed, Reels, or videos. In other words, Instagram only lets you temporarily share someone else’s content for 24 hours max. If you do want to keep it permanently, you can add it to an Instagram Story Highlight. If you’re looking to add a post to your permanent feed and credit the original creator, I’ll show you how to do that in the next sections. For now, let me show you how I repost content to my Story and add it to my highlights. 1. Navigate to the post, Reel, or video you want to repost. I start by scouring Instagram for content that fits my brand. That could be regular posts, Reels, or videos. I do this in the following ways: Sometimes, I’ll search for popular industry hashtags to find great posts from other brands and influencers; Other times, I’ll look at my branded hashtags to see if any customers or fans have posted user-generated content. I also check for posts I have been tagged in and repost any that align with my brand. I keep an eye on the feeds of brands I admire to find posts that align with my style. Note: Remember that you can only repost content from users and brands with public profiles. You can also repost other people’s Stories, so long as you’re tagged in them. You can find those who’ve mentioned you in their Story in your Direct Messages. If you’d like to connect better with people who tag you in their content, Social Inbox can help you with that. This social media management software by HubSpot allows you to publish social media content from the same place you build campaigns, set up keyword monitoring so you Templates2. Tap the new post button. Once I have my screenshot, I head back to my Instagram account. At the middle bottom of the screen, I tap the plus sign inside a square. Then, I choose Post (this is the default setting, and there are other options like Story, Reel, and Live, but Post is what I need). Pro tip: If you’re using Instagram to boost engagement, consider experimenting with different formats (like Reels) for reposting content. You might discover that certain types of posts TemplatesResharing on Instagram Best Practices When resharing content on Instagram, here are some best practices to keep in mind: 1. Engage with the original creator and their community. Whenever I repost someone else’s photo, I like to leave a thoughtful comment on their original post and respond to any comments they might have on my repost. You can do the same — this open dialogue helps you build deeper connections with other creators, which can lead to future collaborations or mutual shares. 2. Be transparent about sponsored content. If you’re sharing user-generated content that you or your sponsor wants to highlight, make sure you follow Instagram’s guidelines and FTC regulations. For example, I’ll include #sponsored or #ad in the caption if there’s any form of brand deal. You don’t want your followers (or the FTC) thinking you’re misleading them. 3. Incorporate your own angle. When you repost content, don’t be afraid to add your personal twist to it. For example, I often include a sentence or two in my caption explaining why this particular post grabbed my attention or how it connects to my brand’s goals. You should do something similar: take a moment to share your perspective so your followers understand what makes the repost valuable or relevant. 4. Time your reposts strategically. Timing can be everything on Instagram. I once experimented by sharing reposts during different times of day and noticed that my posts got more engagement when I shared them around lunchtime or early evening. You’ll want to keep an eye on your Insights or analytics to figure out when your followers are most active, then schedule your reposts accordingly. 5. Watch how often you repost. Reposting too often without posting your original content can make your account feel like a patchwork of other people’s posts. You don’t want to make the mistake of reposting so frequently that your own content gets lost in the shuffle. Instead, strike a balance by spacing out your reposts and mixing in plenty of original content to keep your Stories personal (or professional) and engaging. P.S. If you’re having trouble creating enough original content for your Instagram, check out Breeze, an AI-powered social media agent that can generate post suggestions that align perfectly with your brand, target audience, and brand identity. It can also analyze your social performance, brand details, and marketing best practices to build a multi-channel social media strategy to boost awareness and drive conversions. However, if you already have post ideas but want to expand (or shorten) your copy, HubSpot’s AI social media post generator can help with that. It can help you overcome writer’s block, create compelling captions, repurpose posts by channel, and generate multiple AI-assisted Instagram posts you can schedule to go live at a later date. Best Apps for Reposting on Instagram 1. Repost: Posts, Stories, Reels Price: Free with in-app purchases Source For Instagram for iOS or Android. The app integrates directly with Instagram, so you can share content from other Instagram users from your mobile device. If your brand’s Instagram profile follows a distinct brand style guide, Repost can help you customize your reposts to adhere to those guidelines. You can pick from 50+ different text styles and symbol art to create eye-catching captions to capture more attention. 2.",

    "title": "Should you use AI logo generators for your business? Here's my honest recommendation",
    "content": "Given how logos are such an essential part of brand identity, I was skeptical of using AI logo generators. A wrong logo decision cost Tropicana over $30 million in sales. I hated X’s decision to ditch the small Twitter bird just as much as the other 78% of U.S. iOS users who gave it a 1-star review. On the other hand, Nike’s $35 swoosh logo and Coca-Cola’s handwritten logo are billion-dollar cultural symbols. Startups and SMBs might spend $5-$5000 on a logo, but for major corporations, rebrands can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. In contrast, AI logo generators promise to give you multiple logo options for just $20-$200. While cheaper isn’t always better, AI has become surprisingly good in creative fields like content and marketing. So, I tested the top six logo generators to see if AI could handle branding and produce logos I’d actually use for my clients. Table of Contents How I Tested the Best AI Logo Generators 6 of the Best AI Logo Generators My Favorite AI Logo Generator Should your business use an AI logo generator?How I Tested the Best AI Logo Generators While most AI generators promise you “professional logos” in minutes, only a handful delivered results I’d consider talking about. One common problem I kept running into was templated logos. So, I set some ground rules while testing these logo makers. Specifically, I considered the following factors: Adaptability. I work across industries, and my AI designer needs to adapt and resonate with different target audiences. Uniqueness. If my logo looks templated, I’m hitting next. Format coverage. You want your logo to shine across all distribution channels. So, the logo maker should give you all the file formats needed to make that happen. Cost. Most AI logo generators aren’t pricey, but I’m always looking for the best value. Logo generators in this article may not fulfill all four criteria, but each one offers something unique. To make sure I cover both ends of the spectrum, I decided to split my tests between two businesses I’d love to own someday: Rio’s Dog Cafe and Nexora, an AI startup. It turned out to be a fun experiment since I was working on my passion projects. To test these six AI generators, I signed up on their platforms, filled in the brand details, and wrote custom prompts when needed. I also timed how much time each test took. Read on to see the final logos and to learn if I’d recommend using an AI logo generator for your business.HubSpot's AI Image Generator Transform text into AI-customized images that perfectly match your content. Go to your preferred content tool Find the image generator feature Enter a text prompt or content input Generate and insert your imageLearn More6 of the Best AI Logo Generators Here are my top six AI logo generators. 1. Canva Price: 50 AI design credits monthly on free plan, 150 credits on Canva Pro ($15/user/month) Time to test: 2 minutes 30 seconds As a social media marketer, I use Canva extensively for client work. Their pre-existing templates have been great at helping me draft fresh carousel designs, banners, or sales decks. I’ve even generated a trending Studio Ghibli-style presentation using their AI tool. To test Canva’s logo generation features, I decided to use the brand, Nexora. Canva AI is very intuitive, featuring a chatbox-like interface, design categories, and tutorials for specific use cases. Here’s the prompt I gave for Nexora: “Design a clean, and minimalistic, modern colored logo for Nexora, a next-generation AI assistant designed to help individuals and teams think, plan, and act faster. The logo should reflect intelligence and simplicity.” I could even upload any previous design files, reference images, etc., with my prompt if I wanted. Canva’s AI logo generator gave me these three decent options. I also like how it prompted me to explore other angles and design tweaks to improve the logo. The best part? I could click on the logo I liked and open it in Canva’s editor to make further changes. There, I had complete access to Canva’s other features, including my existing projects, brand-specific assets, and apps. That means you can superimpose any finalized logo directly into your existing Canva assets with just a few clicks. How I’d Use the Canva AI Logo Generator As I mentioned earlier, I already use Canva for multiple client deliverables. When it comes to logos, though, I’d stick to using it for initial concepts. While Canva AI generates logo options quickly, you can’t modify AI-generated elements within its editor. Even a change in color scheme would mean a new prompt. Since branding work hinges on iterations, Canva AI is only effective as a brainstorming tool. What I liked: An intuitive interface that allows you to generate text, images, videos, and code through just prompts. Design prompt suggestions to make the final output better. Seamless integration with other Canva features like projects, apps, and the editor. What I didn’t like: Inability to edit AI-generated elements. The credit limit makes it difficult to generate multiple designs. 2. ChatGPT Price: The free version has limits on image generation. ChatGPT Plus costs $20/month, while Pro costs $200/month. Time to test: 4 minutes 20 seconds Since GPT-4o started supporting image generation features, I’ve noticed a significant improvement in the quality of the images generated by ChatGPT. The new model follows my prompts more accurately and generates solid product mockups, stock images, and design concepts. To test its logo-making capabilities specifically, I opened a new chat. I used the same prompt I used for Canva for Nexora, our AI agent. Not bad. I liked the typography in the logo, while I wasn't a big fan of the circle surrounding it. So, I prompted it to remove the circle and give me other design options. As you can see, it followed my instructions to the letter and gave me a usable logo. Since it did a great job with this brand, I decided to create a logo for my dog cafe too. While it didn’t adhere to the coffee request, I was pretty impressed with this logo. Perhaps I am biased when it comes to dog images, but this logo makes me want to visit the actual cafe. How I’d Use ChatGPT as an AI Logo Maker If I wanted to get a business up and running quickly, I’d consider using ChatGPT’s logos as solid placeholders before investing in custom design. If I have the budget for a professional designer, I’d use ChatGPT to generate design briefs for my vision. What I liked: Good sense of design with the ability to follow prompts accurately. Decent editing capabilities within the GPT 4-o interface. A ChatGPT subscription unlocks additional features, including content creation, video production, and AI agents. What I didn’t like: Sometimes ignores specific elements of prompts (such as the coffee thing). No option to generate vector files directly. 3. Gemini Price: Free image generation (with limits), $20/month for access to image and video generation. Time to test: 2 minutes Google’s Gemini is a popular choice for AI image generation. With over 400 million monthly active users, I was curious to see if it could produce better logos than ChatGPT. I tested Gemini with the same prompt I had given GPT 4-o. This Nexora logo is my favorite so far. My only issue was the “AI” text embedded in the logo, which looked unnecessary. Easy enough to edit out manually, so I wasn’t too bothered. I also really like how Gemini walks me through its creative process when I click the “Show Thinking” dropdown. As you can see, Gemini gives me a list of parameters it considered and the exact keywords it focused on. If I want the next version to focus on other aspects (such as being corporate or approachable), I know exactly what I need to adjust in my prompt using this information. This process makes it feel like you’re collaborating with a designer, rather than an AI logo maker. The best part? Since Gemini integrates with Google products, including my Pixel phone, I can even test design concepts and logos on the go. Pretty convenient, especially for busy business owners. How I’d Use Gemini as an AI Logo Maker Similar to ChatGPT, I can use Gemini’s logos as starter assets for an early-stage business or product feature. However, I’d lean more on using Gemini to brainstorm design briefs, mainly due to the “thinking feature.” What I liked: High-quality logos, even on the free plan. Premium plans have a 1-month trial. Gemini generated an image faster than ChatGPT. Seamless integration with Google products and easy accessibility. What I didn’t like: Minimal editing options. Can’t generate vector files directly. 4. Looka Price: $20 for low-resolution files of your logo; $65 for the high-resolution version of one logo and support; $96/year for a brand kit; and $129/year for a brand kit and AI-generated website. Time to test: 1 minute 45 seconds Looka is similar to Wix, but without the chatbot or the generated taglines. This is the process I followed to get my end logo: Enter your business name. Select a style or inspo for your logo. Choose your symbols and icons to incorporate. Add your slogan. Pick a generated image to tweak or customize.However, one of the reasons I wanted to add Looka to this list is that it goes beyond logos. After finalizing my logo, I’m presented with the option to add it to various brand assets. The brand kit subscription includes essentials like letterheads, social profiles, and business cards, all with your logo already integrated. I find this brand kit feature great for products at the MVP stage. You can even get an AI-generated website done for you at their most expensive package. How I’d Use Looka as an AI Logo Maker As a developer, I have shipped many internal tools and dashboards. Using Looka, I could have presented them as mini products to stakeholders, complete with a logo, website, and branding assets. Looka is also helpful for testing new product features in the market. What I liked: Ideal for experimenting with mini products and features. 100+ branded templates and mockups using your new logo are included in the subscription. You also have the option to create an AI-generated website. Dedicated support team to help tweak your logos. What I didn’t like: No Chatbot or AI prompting features. Basic customization options. 5. Adobe Express Logo Maker (BETA) Price: Free, but you must sign up for Adobe Express to download the logo. Time to test: 1 minute 50 seconds Adobe is the gold standard for design. I’ve used many Adobe products before, including Photoshop for creating banners and Illustrator for designing vector logos. Each product generally has a rich template library, plus community-made premium templates that are great for challenged artists like me. Given this track record, I had high expectations of their logo maker. The experience itself was simple and fast. I first entered my brand name (“Rio’s dog cafe”) and slogan, and then chose an icon based on my industry keywords like “coffee” and “pet.” After this step, I could select a logo style (minimal, bold, elegant, organic), colors, and a logo mockup as a starting base. The tool uses this information to generate a sample logo in under 20 seconds. Next comes customization. You need to make an account for this step, but it’s fairly quick to do with social logins. Once you’re logged in, you’ll see the Adobe Express editor for more granular customization. Change colors, play around with image placements, or upload your own icons if you don’t find a suitable icon. You can also add simple animations like sliding into focus or logo spins for digital media. Although I like the overall idea behind the logo, the execution felt a bit flat. The final logo lacks the professional polish I’ve grown to expect from Adobe tools. Another concerning part is the lack of AI prompting capabilities. Since the tool relies on its existing icon library, you might end up using the same logo as 100 other companies. How I’d Use Adobe Express Logo Maker You can use Adobe’s logo maker to generate ideas, explore quick color combinations for an existing logo, or just play around with different styles. However, I would not recommend using it to make company logos from scratch. What I liked: Access to a drag-and-drop design interface without needing to download software. A fairly responsive editing process, with minimal lag and rendering issues. Ability to add simple animations. What I didn’t like: No AI prompting features for strategic design. Basic customization capabilities. Clip-art style icons and limited typography options. 6. Wix Price: You must subscribe to Wix to download high-quality images of your logo, but you can download a low-resolution version for free. Wix subscription plans start from $17/month to $159/month. Time to test: 3 min 30 seconds Wix is quite popular with my website developer friends, so I was pleasantly surprised to see they have an AI logo generator feature, too. You can either choose to go the chatbot route (I recommend this) or generate it manually. I started with the chatbot, and honestly, it was pretty engaging. Once I sent over the details, Wix came up with some great taglines to accompany my logo. After a bit of back and forth with the chatbot, the final logo was ready. You can use Wix’s logo editor to customize any specific elements, download files for digital and print use, or add it to your Wix website. My final logo isn’t very impressive, so while the overall experience was nice, I think Wix needs to work on their design aesthetic. Designing the logo on my own was a similar experience to previous generators, so it isn’t much to write about. How I’d Use Wix as an AI Logo Maker I wouldn’t use Wix as an end-to-end AI logo maker. Instead, I would prefer to use their chatbot to brainstorm color palettes, taglines, and backgrounds for my logo. What I liked: Decent color palette and symbol options Good tagline suggestions. What I didn’t like: Logo doesn’t look as professional. You need a subscription to download high-quality versions of the logo.My Favorite AI Logo Generator Through this experiment, I found that AI logo generators are excellent at coming up with creative concepts. The actual logo though? Not something I’d recommend as a final client deliverable. I particularly liked ChatGPT and Gemini’s output more than the other logo makers. Looka is also a good mockup tool for new features and products. Overall, though, I’d recommend using AI logo generators as starting points for your brainstorming process. My experience aligns with how other industry professionals are using these tools. Courtney Vickery, a branding specialist at Declet Designs, shared her process with me: “When I‘m working on custom branding and brainstorming logo concepts, I’ll use tools like Midjourney or DALL-E to help me think through ideas — but I never use what it gives me directly. It's purely for fleshing out concepts and getting my creative wheels turning. The actual logos are always 100% custom work.” Should your business use an AI logo generator? If you really want to use an AI logo generator to save time or money, go for ChatGPT, Gemini, or Canva. However, I don’t recommend using an AI generator for your logo beyond initial concepts. This experiment shows that most AI logo generators generate similar results. These tools simply cannot handle unique positioning challenges or changing consumer psychology beyond a point. So, if you want a unique logo, it’s best to design one from scratch or hire a good graphic designer. Even when choosing a designer for your brand, I recommend asking questions about their design process and how they utilize AI. My parting tips: Ensure your logo captures your brand, looks good on both print and digital platforms, and has that human touch.

    "content": "If you want to find the best time to post on Instagram, you're probably trying to ReportWhat are the best times to post on Instagram? The best time to post on Instagram is from 12-3PM or 6-9PM. Friday is considered the best day for engagement, followed closely by Saturday and Sunday. The evening 6 PM-8:59 PM is frequently noted as having high engagement levels. The times above are for Instagram engagement in local time — meaning that your audience is in the same time zone as you are when you post. So, if you live in Los Angeles and your primary audience is also in Los Angeles, you would post at the times above. However, if you live in Los Angeles and your tar ReportBuilding a Loyal Audience Loyalty takes time and effort to build. It's especially tough for small businesses that have to compete with big brands on social media. Fortunately, posting during peak times on Instagram helps you reach more of your audience and start building that relationship. Building loyalty is more than great products and customer service, however. It’s also about reliability. Posting at peak times helps establish a consistent presence in your followers' lives and sets expectations of when they can hear from you. For example, say you run your media business in the Pacific time zone, but a third of your customers are in the Australian Eastern time zone. If you post all your content from 9 AM - 5 PM PST, those posts will appear between 3-11 AM for your Australian customers and many won’t see them. And what if an unhappy customer in Australia posts a story about your brand that you miss? That one miss could shape that entire audience's perception of your business. Understanding when your audience is online can be key to meeting them where they are and fostering brand loyalty. Testing New Algorithms Like most online tools, Instagram launches regular updates to improve its user experience. As a business, your team needs to quickly understand how each update could impact your users and adapt your strategy. This is especially true of algorithm updates. Algorithms are complex. Instagram leaders say that each part of the app uses an independent algorithm, and they aren’t always transparent about what they entail. If you’re lucky, social media analysts will do the research and share them online quickly, but if not, you can do your own by monitoring your post performance. What do you need to run reliable and useful tests to help you understand which content your users see after an update? Number one is a consistent posting schedule. The fewer variables your test has, the more trustworthy your results will be. Posting at the best times for your audience on Instagram will ReportIs there really a “best time” to post to Instagram? It‘s clear that posting time matters on Instagram. But is there really a best time to post to ReportBest Time Each Day to Post on Instagram Every day of the week is a good day to post on Instagram, but you're likely to ReportHow to Find the Right Time to Post to Instagram for Reach Data on the best posting times for Instagram is incredibly useful. That said, it‘s often most effective when you’re just starting out. As you continue to develop your presence on the platform, you might want to boost your results and do some posting time research on your own. The tips below are useful places to start. 1. Use a Social Media Tool The most effective way to find the best posting time on Instagram is to use a social media tool, which will allow you to post at different times without needing to log into Instagram each time. Social media software is useful not only because you won’t need to remember to log in to Instagram — you can simply schedule your posts — but because you can test and experiment more precisely.Try HubSpot’s social media tool for free! Plus, you can see your posting history through reports — there’s no need to go through your Instagram posts one by one. 2. Experiment with Posting Times To find the best time to post for your brand, it’s essential to experiment. Our 2023 data strongly suggests that posting in the evening hours from 6 to 9 PM is a great place to start. Then, test out another time — such as lunchtime or mid-afternoon — and see if that changes engagement rates for your posts. Try to keep the type of posts you make consistent. For instance, test out posting times for Reels specifically, with similar caption lengths and subject matter. That way, the only variable is the posting time itself and not any other characteristic. 3. Check Your Top Posts Tracking your top posts can help you understand what posts are most popular and which topics draw the most engagement. It can also help you see how posting time impacts those factors. For example, is that recent post about company events the most exciting content for an online beauty company? Or did it generate the most likes last month because it was posted on Saturday evening, a top time for ecommerce engagement? You can use Instagram Insights to check out your top-performing posts, as well as factors like: Engaged audience Total followers Most active times HubSpot customers: You can check the Top Posts report for a quick list of your top ten posts. You can also check interactions, clicks, shares, and impressions for each post. As you start to look at your social analytics, it can be tempting to focus on the numbers. But when you‘re looking at top posts, it’s important to stick with your creative side and to look at your numbers from your customer's point of view. As you check your top posts, ask yourself: What is special about this post? What kind of content is it? If it's a video, what makes this video stand out? If it‘s a photograph, how is this photo different from the others you’ve posted? Did you edit the post? Did you add text or design elements to the post? Is there something that ties the people who've liked this post together? Does this post connect to a current trend or event? You may want to gather top post insights for a few months before you dig into analyzing your post content. This can help you see the top content your users respond to and when they want to see that type of content. 4. Track Competitor Posting Times Another way to choose the right time to post for your audience is to figure out who else has their attention. Starting with your top competitors helps you figure out when to post and what content works on different days and times. Competitive analysis can also help you: Learn about trends and benchmarks in your niche Update your social strategy Pinpoint new opportunities There are a few ways to begin this research. First, just scrolling through Instagram can give you a wealth of competitor insights. Take a look at a brand's likes, hashtag copy, and how many hashtags they use. This can give you a quick profile of who follows that brand and what keywords they use, so it can hint at that competitor’s strategy. If you want to do more detailed research, there are many great tools to help you track your competition. For example, you can create competitor streams with HubSpot's social media software.Try HubSpot’s social media tool for free! With this feature, you can track multiple competitors at once and filter your results by social network or time period. 5. Focus On Engagement Strong engagement on Instagram is between 1-5%. According to HubSpot research, the average engagement in 2021 was 5.86%. The average engagement rate for 2020 was just 2.26%, so these rates can change quickly. If you want to improve engagement, start by calculating your Instagram engagement rate. You can measure your rate with your all-time numbers, but it can be helpful to break this data into smaller sections, like months or weeks. That way you can see engagement patterns for your account over time. It can also make it easier to see how the times you post on Instagram could impact your engagement rate. Engagement rates show how people are reacting to your content. So, whether you're sharing Reels, going live on Stories, or posting polls, questions, and quizzes, you can measure your impact. Engagement rates can sway based on: Audience interest Relevance Social authority It's also important to remember that your most engaging content may not be as sticky at the same hours each day. Some content takes time to pick up views and shares before it makes an impact during peak engagement hours. Other content is like a firework — exploding quickly and disappearing just as fast. To optimize your post timing for engagement, you need to get organized. The best way to find an ideal posting time is by testing the timing of your posts to see which post time generates the most audience engagement. For example, what if you want to figure out when you get the most likes and comments on your Instagram carousels? Say you create and post five different carousels a week and post them at random times. That approach will make it tough to get data that shows you the best times to post carousels for engagement. But what if you post five similar carousels at a slightly different time each day? Then you can compare your engagement rates with the time you posted each carousel. This can show you the best time to post carousels for engagement so you can plan future carousels with those times in mind. 6. Use Your Data When you're new to Instagram, follower and engagement numbers are often low. Numbers for posting time, content type, hashtags, and more can be so similar that you may not spot the patterns that can help you grow. Social media analytics can make these patterns easier to see and experiment with. For example, the audience section in Instagram Insights can show you the days and hours when your followers are active. You can use that information to create a posting schedule. This can help you see whether posting during peak hours improves your reach. At the same time, it's important to remember that anyone with an account has access to Instagram Insights. And according to our 2024 survey, 48% had 100k to 450k followers. So, there‘s a good chance that other brands are showing up in your followers’ feeds during that active time. You may want to post outside of active hours to see if your account draws more attention when there's less competition. It's great to have the best times on Instagram available when planning your strategy. But tracking your own data can give you the personalized insights you need to stand out. Boost Instagram Engagement on Your Schedule Organic Instagram engagement and a consistent posting schedule go hand in hand. Each industry has natural peaks and valleys of activity each day. This means that your Instagram strategy should flow with them. Use helpful resources, like this cheat sheet, to plan your social media calendar and watch your engagement rate soar.

    "title": "How to Answer ‘What Makes You Unique?’ & Stand Out in Your Next Interview",
    "content": "Whenever I GuideWhy do interviewers ask ‘What sets you apart from other candidates?’ The interviewer is asking you this question to give you an opportunity to showcase your value. They want to see that you’ve done thorough research about the company and the position. And they want you to connect your skills and experience back to the role you’re interviewing for. For example, let’s say I’m trying to land a social media role, and I notice that the company could be doing a better job on TikTok. I can use this as an opportunity to: Show that I’ve done my homework — I’m already familiar with the company’s social media presence and the platforms where it’s currently active (e.g., TikTok). Highlight relevant skills — I have several years of experience managing and growing TikTok accounts, so I’ll be sure to mention that. Provide a light recommendation — I’ll share how my skills and experience allow me to identify and implement that recommendation. Think about it like this: If you can show the interviewer that you can help the company meet its goals (and that you know what its goals are in the first place), that’s one great way to set yourself apart from the rest. Plus, it becomes clear to the interviewer that you’ve taken the time to prepare if you can provide specific examples related to the role. These are all reasons why this is such a popular interview question — so come ready, and don’t be afraid to humble brag about yourself a little.How to Answer 'What makes you unique?'Mention the skills listed in the job description.Provide specific examples from your background.Avoid generic phrases like ‘I'm a hard worker.’Include key personality traits that will allow you to deliver results.Tell the interviewer how your unique skills will help the company succeed.My colleague Jamie Juviler, managing editor of our esteemed Website Blog, recently hired a new writer on his team. Here’s his advice for answering ‘What makes you unique?’: “I would say don’t stress about providing a highly unique answer or something that no other candidate has said, since that’s unlikely,” says Juviler. “Instead, use this as another opportunity to highlight a skill or attribute that you may not have had the chance to share yet. I see it as a wild card where the candidate can share anything else they’re proud of and solidify what makes you stand out.” Here are five other tips to consider. 1. Mention the skills listed in the job description. This is one of the best ways to show the interviewer that you’ve done your research. Also, the job description is basically like your cheat sheet. Use it as a guide so you know exactly which skills to highlight throughout the interview. My recommendation: Refer back to the job description but don’t recite it word for word. Use it in context to explain how your skillset aligns with the role's expectations. 2. Provide specific examples from your background. This is another smart way you can use the job description to your advantage. Reference prior accomplishments or results from past roles that relate to the position you’re interviewing for. My recommendation: Focus on examples that tie back to the skills required for the position, and always quantify success where possible. Using our social media example, saying ‘I ran a social media campaign which resulted in a 120% increase in traffic to our website’ is a lot more impactful than ‘I have experience running social media campaigns.’ 3. Avoid generic phrases like “I'm a hard worker.” Remember, this is a very standard interview question, so that means every candidate is likely being asked this question. Make your answer compelling. Instead of saying you're a ‘hard worker,’ give specific examples of the hard work you’ve accomplished related to the role. My recommendation: Try to avoid the common buzzwords and instead replace those with real descriptions of your past work. For example, you and every other candidate for a social media position probably consider yourself “social media savvy.” Instead, make the case to prove that you are actually savvier than the competition based on your unique background. 4. Include key personality traits that will allow you to deliver results. Someone else might have similar skills as you, but your personality is one of a kind. Being ‘social media savvy’ is one thing. But if you’re social media savvy and a tenacious person who is able to think quickly on your feet, that’s an asset. Highlight the traits that have proven value in helping you grow as a professional. My recommendation: You want to know one of my favorite ways to convince interviewers that I can deliver the results they’re looking for? Tell them how I’ve found similar success in the past and how my individuality supported that. 5. Tell the interviewer how your unique skills will help the company succeed. This closely relates back to Tip #3. Don’t just talk about generic skills that most candidates have — always tie your skills back to specific projects you’ve worked on. Your background is what makes you unique. There’s no one person that has the exact experience, skills, and traits that you do. Use that to your advantage. My recommendation: You may not know the company's internal goals, but you should always try to connect your skills to their mission and values when possible. 7 Sample Answers to “What Makes You Unique?” and Why They Work 1. “I am a very good communicator and find it easy for me to relate to other people.” Consider mentioning a personality trait you feel would be a good fit for the business. After reading the job description, make a list of attributes that could make you an exceptional candidate. Additionally, including a personality trait in your answer allows you to display how you're a good fit for a role in which you have little prior experience. For instance, if you‘re applying for a position as a team leader, it’s critical that you demonstrate strong communication skills and an ability to connect with a diverse group of people. If you tell the interviewer, “I am a very good communicator and find it easy for me to relate to other people,” you can match your personality to the components of a successful leader. Why this works: Effective communication is a critical trait to emphasize in interviews. If you consider how 86% of employees cite lack of collaboration as a main component of workplace failures, you can begin to appreciate why. 2. “I really enjoy learning new things and am constantly seeking out new learning opportunities.” By mentioning your passion for learning new things, you‘re demonstrating you’re growth-focused and unafraid of challenges. Additionally, answering the question in this way allows you to remind the interviewer why you're uniquely qualified for the role. Why this works: While other candidates might have more prior experience in the industry, you're proving your desire to exceed expectations of the job quickly. 3. “My prior experience in customer service has provided me with unique technical skills that I can apply to this role.” If you have prior experience in a role vastly different from the one for which you're applying, you might use this as an opportunity to explain how your background uniquely qualifies you. It's critical, however, that you provide specific examples of how your prior experience has given you certain transferable skills. For instance, you might say the following: “My prior experience in customer service provided me with an extensive knowledge base for how our product works. As a marketer, I will be able to use this knowledge to ensure we're meeting our customers' needs.” It's also important to highlight that previous job experience has declined in importance when recruiters evaluate candidates. In fact, over the last few years, that number has dropped from 92% to 62%. So it‘s okay if you feel your prior work experience doesn’t perfectly align with the role for which you're applying — as long as you can explain how your skills will help you succeed. Why this works: An answer like this one alleviates concerns the interviewer might have about your lack of experience in the field.Access 50+ More Interview Questions Make a lasting impression in your next interview with the help of this guide. Company-Specific Questions About You Questions Leadership Questions Plus Interview Tips! Guide4. “Working at a startup gave me an opportunity to understand the ins and outs of the industry, and to take on tasks I might not have at a larger company. I think this experience gives me a slight edge over other applicants.” Similar to the answer above, this answer is a good one if you're attempting to switch industries. Consider how your background has allowed you to gain unique skills that others, who followed a more linear career trajectory, might not have. For instance, if you previously worked at a small startup and now you want to transfer to a large corporation, it's important you mention how those skills will make you successful in this new role. Why this works: If you think your prior experience could deter interviewers from seeing you as exceptionally qualified, this is an optimal chance to prove them wrong. 5. “I'm not afraid of failure. In fact, I think it is an essential part of the experimental process that Guide",

    "title": "20 Creative Interview Questions (With Sample Answers)",
    "content": "As a hiring manager, asking questions like, “What's the greatest challenge you've overcome?\" is important to learn about an applicant. But what creative interview questions will help paint a fuller picture of a potential candidate? Imagine you ask your candidate: “If you were a pizza delivery person, how would you benefit from scissors?” The question changes the conversation. Suddenly, you've caught your candidate off-guard. Traditional interview questions are still necessary, but funny or unexpected questions like the following can provoke a more honest, insightful conversation during your interview. Funny Interview Questions 1. “How would you solve problems if you were from Mars?” This question, asked by Amazon, helps you see if your candidate can think outside what‘s traditional or typical. You’ll want your candidate to demonstrate problem-solving ability even under bizarre circumstances. Her answer can show you whether she can enter a new workplace environment and evaluate it fairly before offering solutions. For instance, an ideal candidate might say, “If I were on Mars, they'd likely have their problems separate from those on Earth. First, I'd research to determine cause and effect and then offer potential solutions.” With this answer, your candidate has shown an ability to be thoughtful and analytical when making decisions. 2. “What do you think of garden gnomes?” This question, asked by Trader Joe's, is ridiculous. More than anything else, it's intended to loosen the candidate, see a glimpse of their personality, and gain insight into a cultural fit. There‘s no correct answer to this question, but if your team likes to be sarcastic with one another, you might want a candidate to say, \"If I could Guide4. “You’ve been given an elephant. You can’t give it away or sell it. What would you do with the elephant?” This ConnectWise question helps you better understand your candidate‘s reasoning skills. Of course, there’s no “right” answer to this funny question. Still, it lets you know how your candidate thinks, prioritizes, and problem-solves. Additionally, it can loosen the candidate up and allow her to show you a more authentic side. Your candidate might say, “Since I don't have a place to put an elephant, I'd probably send it on vacation,” or “I would feed it and then ride it to work.” It‘s important to note you aren’t looking for a specific answer here — you're determining how your candidate thinks on her feet and handles herself in unexpected situations. 5. “If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be and why?” Ask this bizarre Walgreens question to test your candidate‘s creativity. However, ideally, your candidate’s answer will give you insight into her strengths related to the role and what kind of person she is. Your ideal candidate should say, “I would be an oak tree because I'm strong and dependable.” Of course, it doesn‘t matter what tree she chooses — as long as she uses her answer to show you why she’s a good fit for the position. 6. “If you were a dessert, what would you be?” The answer to this question can give insight into how candidates see themselves and their ability to think creatively. Your ideal candidate would explain the reasoning behind their answer. If their answer includes a bit of humor, you can infer the candidate can laugh at themselves and be a good fit within your organization's culture. An example of a good answer would be: “I would be a cheesecake because they are versatile and can be adapted to different tastes depending on the toppings you add. I consider myself a very creative person who can adapt to different situations or pivot when necessary so the team can reach its goals.” Creative & Interesting Interview Questions 7. “We finish the interview, and you step outside the office and find a lottery ticket to win $10 million. What would you do?” This question is fantastic for determining your candidate‘s true motivation in a role. You don’t want to hire someone who only wants the job to make money — you want a candidate who also finds genuine fulfillment in the part. Since corporations whose employees are engaged perform over 200% better than those without, you must hire a fully engaged performer. Your ideal candidate will say: “I'd use the $10 million to travel, donate to charity, and provide for my family. However, I'd still want to work for your company. I've always enjoyed working in marketing, and I think this company greatly emphasizes creativity and storytelling to help brands spread their message. So while I'd love to Guide10. “Are you a hunter or a gatherer?” If you aren't hiring an anthropologist, this might seem like a ridiculous question. But companies like Dell ask this question to gain critical insights into a candidate's strengths and weaknesses. You want your candidate to focus her answer on the qualifications of the specific role. For instance, if you‘re hiring for a content creator role, you’ll want your candidate to say, “I'm a gatherer. I enjoy collecting critical SEO data and insights over time and tailoring my content to reach long-term goals.” Ultimately, hunters and gatherers are two very different categories of people. This question can help you quickly discern the strengths and weaknesses your candidate will likely display in the role. 11. “If you could only read one book for the rest of your life, what would it be?” This answer will help you assess the candidate's priorities and interests. An example of an ideal answer would be: \"I would read ‘The Altar of My Soul’ by Marta Moreno because her story shows the importance of community and family, two things I hold dear. Furthermore, I always learn new lessons each time I revisit the book and am always open to learning something new.\" Weird, Unusual, & Random Interview Questions 12. “How much do you charge to wash every window in Seattle?” While this might seem odd, it‘s practical to ask if you’re trying to determine how well your candidate can problem-solve. Particularly if you‘re hiring for a client-facing role, you’ll want to see how your candidate handles questions to which she needs to know the answer. Ideally, your candidate will say something like this — “Well, let's say Seattle consists of 10,000 city blocks, with 1,000 windows per block. That's 10 million windows. If I charge $5 per window, I'd make $50 million.” The answer itself doesn‘t matter. It’s more critical your candidate can apply logical problem-solving skills and remain calm when dealing with challenging or unexpected questions. 13. “Design a spice rack for the blind.” Your candidate's answer to this random question shows a lot about how she makes decisions. For instance, perhaps your candidate wants to interview blind people and do competitive research before deciding. This tells you she's someone who places value on research and analytics. Alternatively, your candidate says she'd create braille labels on each shelf. This tells you she trusts her instinct to make fast judgment calls. Neither answer is wrong — it simply depends on the type of person you need to fill the role. 14. “How many pennies would fit into this room?” Ipreo asks this question for Product Analyst interviews. A brain teaser like this is an excellent opportunity to see how a candidate can use logic to solve seemingly impossible challenges. You‘ll want your candidate to say something like this — \"I’d need to measure how many pennies fit length-wise, width-wise, and height-wise. Then I'd simply multiply those three numbers.\" This answer demonstrates an ability to use simple math to create formulas for more complex problems. However, it‘s also impressive if your candidate asks you questions in return. Perhaps she’d say, “Well, will this room still have furniture, or would we remove it? Also, what's the volume of the room? Once I have that information, I could do the math based on the volume of a penny.” Asking questions like these show your candidate thinks outside the box and likes to ask second-level questions before delivering a solution to a problem. Unique interview questions 15. “If you had a choice between two superpowers, being invisible or flying, which would you choose?” On the surface, this sounds like a question you heard at sleepaway camp when you were 12. But Forbes found it to indicate potential leadership ability, with 72% of surveyed leaders choosing the ability to fly over being invisible. If you think about it, this question asks, “Do you prefer to be in the spotlight or more behind the scenes?” Of course, this shouldn‘t be your only question to determine a candidate’s personality and cultural fit. Still, it's a good initial indicator of where someone will impact your team most. 16. “What was the last gift you gave someone?” If your candidate is very stiff and formal, consider loosening her up with a question like this one, asked by Gallup during a Data Analyst interview. It should reveal something about your candidate's character. Ideally, it will elicit a warm, emotional response, helping you form a deeper bond with your candidate. For instance, if your candidate says something like, “My brother loves baseball, so a couple of weeks ago, I bought him tickets to a Red Sox game,” you have information to help you create a connection to your candidate and, ideally create an environment in which she feels more comfortable.Access 50+ More Interview Questions Make a lasting impression in your next interview with the help of this guide. Company-Specific Questions About You Questions Leadership Questions Plus Interview Tips! Guide17. “How many square feet of pizza are eaten in the U.S. each year?” This is a tricky question asked by Goldman Sachs during a Programmer Analyst interview. The inquiry aims to test your candidate‘s logical reasoning skills. While you don’t need a candidate to get the “right” answer, you'll want one who remains composed and thoughtful when providing an educated guess. For instance, your ideal candidate might say, “Well, a pizza is roughly one square foot. If the average American eats one-third of a pizza and eats pizza three times a month, that would mean 12 square feet a year. Then, multiply that number by 200 million Americans, and you get 2.4 billion square feet.” 18. “If you could compare yourself with any animal, which would it be and why?” Like the tree question, this question helps you see a candidate's innovativeness, creativity, and quick-thinking skills. Your candidates should use this question to mention their strengths and highlight their good character. For instance, an ideal answer might be, “I'd be a horse. Horses are powerful and capable of functioning well both independently and as a part of a team. Additionally, they are often fast learners.” 19. \"If you could have dinner with any two famous people, dead or alive, who would you choose?\" An answer would give insight into the qualities the candidate admires most in the people they choose. For example, an excellent answer would be: “I would have dinner with both Beyonce and Michael Jackson. Aside from being a huge fan of their music, I also admire their dedication to their craft and how committed they are/were to creating the best experience possible for their fans.” 20. “What was your best day at work?” The ideal candidate would answer in a way that shows their accomplishments, values, and qualities they like in a workplace. An excellent answer would be: “My best day at work was when I was awarded Marketer of the Year for my successful digital campaign. I was proud of my accomplishment, but the highlight was how kind and congratulatory my team was toward me. Working alongside such caring people made me feel valued and happy.” Interview Takeaways for Any Type of Question As an employer or hiring manager, you want your interview questions to help you determine a candidate‘s values, strengths, character, and how well they’d fit into your organization. While many traditional job interview questions are still necessary to determine their experience and skills, it's good to mix things to get a complete picture of a potential employee. As a candidate, you should look into unconventional job interview questions to be prepared to think on your feet. Also, familiarize yourself with the company, its values, and its mission statement to ensure your answers align with the organization.",

    "title": "AI avatars are already here, and these are the trends I’m most bullish on",
    "content": "As the founder of AI newsletter Mindstream, I'm constantly thinking about scale, especially when it comes to content. For me, video was the bottleneck. I wanted to show up consistently, but I didn’t want to spend hours filming, editing, or setting up gear. That’s what led me to explore AI avatars.At first, avatars were just an experimental shortcut for businesses. But over time, they became something more: a flexible way to keep things personal without needing to be physically present. Today, savvy teams are already leveraging avatars. Here are six high-impact ways I’ve seen businesses leverage avatars, along with tools that make it easy to get started.Free AI Agents Playbook This practical guide reveals where to start, which applications deliver real value, and how to implement agents that transform workflows without replacing jobs. Marketing Workflow Automation Sales Acceleration System Operational Excellence Implementation Blueprint6 Ways Businesses Are Leveraging AI Avatars 1. Short-form Content Creation at Scale Creating video used to be slow and frustrating, especially for small businesses with cash-strapped teams. It took forever to film, edit, subtitle, and polish something enough to actually post it. Now, AI avatars are changing the game. Now, you can write a script and let the tools do the rest. I’ve tested Argil, which is specifically built for short-form creators. Once the avatar is in place, it adds captions automatically and even suggests relevant B-roll based on the topic. I noticed the tool still needed reviewing and tweaking, but I didn’t need to start from scratch. I believe this shift will make daily video publishing possible for teams of any size. What used to take hours now takes ten minutes, without compromising quality. And because it’s scalable, you can show up way more consistently, even without a dedicated video producer. Source 2. Localized and Translated Content for Global Reach Translation and localization are also where I see avatars making huge strides. For example, most people know YouTuber Mr. Beast for his over-the-top videos, but what I find equally fascinating is his distribution model. Only around 30% of his audience speaks English, while the rest is made possible through translated content. AI avatars now allow for native-quality lip syncing in multiple languages. I’ve seen HeyGen do this, and the fidelity is honestly mind-blowing. The avatar's lips and voice match perfectly with the new language. Avatars open up international audiences without the need to re-record anything, making it an essential strategy for any content-focused business that wants to expand globally. Source 3. Scalable Sales Outreach and Customer Service Another use case I’m personally excited about is using AI avatars in outbound sales. If you've ever received a Loom from someone scrolling your LinkedIn and pitching you something generic, you know how forgettable that feels. But when you integrate AI avatar tools like Tavus with AI research agents like Clay, which can scrape LinkedIn profiles, you can do much better. With just a name and a few data points, I can generate a tailored video that says, “Hey Sarah, I saw you work at Acme Corp and recently posted about AI coaching. I think you'll find this demo useful.” It’s fast, it’s scalable, and it lands better than any cold email I’ve ever sent. Source 4. Personalized Welcome Videos in Email Marketing Imagine someone joins my newsletter and 30 minutes later they receive a video that looks like you recorded it just for them: “Hey Matt, thanks for signing up to Mindstream. Here’s what you can expect.” Even when people know it’s AI, the gesture still feels personal, and that’s what makes it effective. Tools like Synthesia, which integrate directly with CRM platforms like HubSpot, make it easy to automate videos that are personalized with names, company details, and other contextual client information. As a result, you’re able to deliver human-feeling onboarding at scale, without stepping in front of a camera. Source 5. Virtual Influencers and Brand Ambassadors The virtual influencer space is wild — and honestly, one of the areas I’m most curious about. You may have heard of Lil Miquela, a fully synthetic Instagram influencer who reportedly makes $10 million a year from brand deals. What struck me wasn’t just her popularity; it was the potential for brands to create permanent, programmable spokespeople. With tools like Arcads and Creatify AI, businesses can now build these digital personalities themselves. And, it doesn't have to be high-fashion or ultra-polished. A friend of mine is building a coaching platform where the avatar represents them across all brand touchpoints, from social posts to appointment booking to onboarding content. It’s like spinning up a creative team overnight. And because it’s all synthetic, it scales effortlessly. Source 6. Internal Communication and Training Not all avatar use cases are public-facing. I’ve seen business leaders use avatars for internal updates and briefings as well. Rather than writing a Slack post or a lengthy doc, they can generate a quick video summarizing weekly priorities, news, or metrics. This is particularly helpful for distributed teams. It adds a personal tone and saves time without requiring anyone to go on camera. I’ve also seen teams use avatars to enable employee onboarding, product explainers, or even internal compliance training. Tools like Colossyan and Hour One are worth exploring here. Both offer features designed for structured, scripted video content — ideal for training, learning and development, or announcements — and support slide integration, multilingual output, and team-based video production. Source AI avatars help you scale for a fraction of the cost. When I started following AI avatars, I didn’t expect them to become a core part of how businesses scale video. But over time, I’ve seen how they can empower transformative video strategies. These tools help teams stay consistent, keep a human tone, and remove the bottlenecks that used to slow them down. People still write the scripts. They still shape the message. But the execution? That’s handled. And for any business that wants to do the same, AI avatars are the key. To learn more about AI avatars and how you can use them to improve your business, check out the full episode of The Next Wave below:Free AI Agents Playbook This practical guide reveals where to start, which applications deliver real value, and how to implement agents that transform workflows without replacing jobs.

Maxwell Iskiev Updated 6/26/24 50+ Small Business Ideas for Anyone Who Wants to Run Their O... Shadrack Wanjohi Updated 4/9/25What do cross-country road trips, wedding speeches, and social media marketing have in common? Planning. I definitely can’t help you with your road trip or wedding speech (sorry), but I can help you create a social media content calendar to organize your next marketing campaign. As marketers, we recognize that social media is integral to an effective inbound marketing strategy. With so many social networks available to us, staying organized and planning for when and what we share is crucial. This is exactly where a social media calendar enters the picture. Before we dive into our list of top tools to stay organized, here's what you need to know about social media calendars and why they're essential. Table of ContentsWhat is a social media calendar? Benefits of Using a Social Media Content Calendar & Content Planner How to Create a Social Media Calendar Social Media Templates Social Media Calendar Examples Social Media Content Calendar Tools to Plan Your Messaging How To Create a Social Media Posting Schedule for Your Business How To Create a Content CalendarFree Social Media Content Calendar TemplateWhat is a social media calendar? A social media content calendar is a rundown of your upcoming posts organized by date and time. A social media calendar can be a spreadsheet (HubSpot offers a free one that you can Social Media Calendar Examples 1. Jotform Social Media Calendar Jotform‘s social media calendar isn’t just visually appealing and functional. The tabs at the top reveal your social plan for every channel you execute your strategy on, including in-person or virtual events. If you're modeling your social calendar after this one, I recommend including a tab for content details and who on your team will be responsible for creating the content. You might also have a separate tab for each month to keep things organized. 2. Firefly Marketing Social Media Content Calendar Going a more traditional route with your social media calendar? Try a Google Sheets template like the one created by Firefly Marketing. Each tab is dedicated to a different month, while the worksheet includes every channel you might need across the top. The rows are separated by week, so you can quickly identify the date and time a post is scheduled for publishing. My favorite part of this template is the pre-populated social media holiday column with fun dates that your audience will love. Social Media Content Calendar Tools to Plan Your Messaging As I mentioned above, I handled social media for a nonprofit before working at HubSpot. I was mostly a novice, and the nonprofit was small, so I felt that a template was all I needed. At the same time, a social media content calendar tool would’ve cut my planning time in half and given me more time to focus on creating content to share. Tools are helpful for anyone, regardless of experience level or business size. I tested some of the leading social media calendar tools to give you a sense of how to make them work for your needs, and I compiled my main takeaways below. Consider the following factors (based on your needs): Functionality. Some tools are simple, and you’d use them to plan content before posting it yourself, and others are more advanced, automated tools that go a step further and post content for you.Features. The tool should offer the specific features you need, like managing multiple social media accounts or giving multiple team members access to the dashboard. Customizations. Calendars should let you customize the layout, categories, tags, or other factors relevant to your needs. Ease of use. A user-friendly and intuitive interface makes your job easier and helps you get started faster. Cost. You want a tool that's within budget and includes all the necessary features. Let’s take a look at my tests.HubSpot's Social Media Management Software Time-saving tools to help you prioritize your social interactions — so you can connect with the people who matter most. Manage campaigns. Monitor mentions. Attribute value. And more!Learn MoreNote: I know some of the screenshots of calendars I’ve included look bleak and plain. Yours will undoubtedly look much more complete and valuable than mine. I’m just a helpful guinea pig. 1. HubSpot's 4. Loomly Content Planning, Creation, Publishing, and Calendar Price: A base plan is $32 per month for two users and 10 accounts when you choose the annual agreement. Free Trial: 15-day free trial, no credit card requiredAs I mentioned, some social media content calendars are all-in-one tools offering content planning and publishing. Loomly is one of those tools with content creation, management, and scheduling features. Why I Like This Social Media Calendar Tool I signed up for Loomly’s free trial quickly because I didn’t have to add credit card info, which I know can be a deterrent if you’re just looking to test a tool. It was extremely easy for me to get started, and the step-by-step walkthrough led me through linking my social accounts and drafting my first post. I really appreciated that I could preview how posts look on each platform as I created them. This makes for easy editing and updates instead of deleting a post to make edits after it’s live. I scheduled a few test posts in less than five minutes to get a view of the calendar, and it’s a simple, no-frills look. Each post you schedule uses the platform icon so you can easily tell what’s going where. The image below is an example calendar: And, since it’s an all-in-one tool, linking your accounts means it will also schedule your posts for you. Overall, Loomly is a high-quality tool for anyone looking to plan their social media content at a fair price point. 5. Later Social Media Management Platform & Link in Bio Tool Price: Starter plan is $25 per month or $16.67 billed yearly Free Trial: Basic 14-day free trial, credit card required for feature-rich trial Later is a user-friendly social media calendar and publishing tool that simplifies the process of scheduling and automating posts across various platforms, including Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X, Pinterest, and LinkedIn. It’s meant for organic social media content, so you’ll need to use a different tool for your paid campaigns. I tested the tool for free, but the more feature-rich 14-day trial requires a credit card. Why I Like This Social Media Calendar Tool I’m impressed by Later’s social media calendar. It took me less than two minutes to link my Instagram account to the calendar, and having it linked means I easily scheduled hypothetical posts for publishing on the exact day and time I designated. It’s also an extremely interactive tool, as you can upload your multimedia assets and drag and drop them onto your calendar, which really makes it feel like you’re “building” a calendar…fun, right? The post builder includes all of the elements you’d need to include in your post based on the specific platform you’re scheduling for. Your calendar will undoubtedly look better and fuller than mine, but here’s the monthly calendar view with two sample Instagram posts I created: You can also view your scheduled posts in list view to get a detailed breakdown of each upcoming week. What sets Later apart is its specialized visual planning for Instagram. It offers powerful Instagram scheduling features. You can plan and preview your Instagram grid, schedule carousel posts, and even automatically publish Instagram Stories. I find the focus on the unique visual aesthetic requirements that Instagram demands to be a stand-out feature, making it a go-to tool for businesses or creators heavily invested in the platform. 6.

I found the publishing tool extremely easy to use with little learning curve, making it a great tool if you’re under a time crunch to choose a tool and get started. I quickly linked my X profile, and creating a post took me about five minutes. I especially liked that there’s a live preview option to view your creations come to life in real time. When your content is scheduled, you can toggle monthly, weekly, or list view for a deeper look or filter the calendar by platform. Here’s what the monthly calendar view looks like with three scheduled X posts: A bonus feature worth calling out: Sprout Social's social listening tool lets you uncover niche conversations your audience is interested in so you can join in on the conversation. I did find that this tool isn’t ideal if you focus on Instagram and TikTok because posting content requires an extra step. You have to 9. StoryChief Content Planning and Distribution Price: Individual pricing starts at $210, billed quarterly Free Trial: 7-day free trial, no credit card required With StoryChief's smart calendar, you can better strategize and plan your content strategy across channels. StoryChief is described as a “content distribution platform” that unifies analytics and publishing across multiple channels for a more simplified approach to content creation. Best of all, it syncs with HubSpot and your favorite calendar apps. Why I Like This Social Media Calendar Tool After signing up for the free trial, I was immediately brought to an extremely interactive and helpful walkthrough of the basics of the tool. I felt confident enough after the tutorial to jump right into the tool. I easily linked my X account and scheduled a few sample posts with the easy post builder. I forgot to cancel the posts I scheduled, and they were posted to my account. So, rest assured, the tool works as advertised, and your posts will go live as scheduled. Here’s what the monthly calendar view looks like with my scheduled posts: You can customize how you see your calendar and filter views by channel, campaign level, or content type.How To Create a Social Media Posting Schedule for Your Business Content posting strategies can differ depending on the social media platform, and you should consider not only what you're posting but also when and how often.

    "title": "I tested 8 AI tools for graphic design — here are my prompts, results, and recommendations",
    "content": "My graphic design journey started on Fiverr. I used to sell banners and background removal services for $5. I am not the best designer. Far from it. However, tools like Photoshop and Canva helped me create decent graphics by editing my way through their premium templates.Even with these shortcuts, it was still a lot of work. I used to spend hours tweaking graphics, adjusting colors and fonts, exploring new presets, and watching YouTube tutorials on how to create specific effects in Photoshop. Now, with AI tools for graphic design, I can spin up on-brand banner variations in just a few clicks. I’m also able to give more detailed design briefs to my team, do minor edits myself, and overall, deliver higher-quality designs in half the time. But which tools give you the usable results and, most importantly, the best ROI? I tested the top 8 AI tools for graphic design to find out. In this article, I’ll walk you through the exact testing process, including the prompts I used and the results, and whether I would recommend using AI graphic design tools at all. Table of Contents Why use AI for graphic design? How I Tested the Best AI Graphic Design Tools Best AI Tools for Graphic DesignHubSpot's AI Image Generator Transform text into AI-customized images that perfectly match your content. Go to your preferred content tool Find the image generator feature Enter a text prompt or content input Generate and insert your imageLearn MoreWhy use AI for graphic design? Here are the top 3 benefits of using AI for graphic design. Faster Time to Design According to HubSpot’s State of AI survey, over 40% of marketers use image and design generators like DALL-E and Synthesia. The most common reason? To help them generate designs faster. Here are the most common graphic design use cases I’m seeing for AI: Quick edits. AI is great at resizing, cropping, removing, or changing backgrounds, and making other quick edits to designs. Media content. 38% of marketers use AI to create image-based and video content for social media, print, and more. Tools like ChatGPT, Veo-3, Canva, etc., can render scenes faster, create assets, and generate AI videos. Personalized AI images. With AI, you can easily create dynamic assets for customer segments or seasonal holidays. Image-based trends. AI can help you hop on trends like Studio Ghibli art or create custom memes quickly. Expert tip: I spoke to Robert Avila, an art director from Platinum Black, who shared how he uses AI to create animations: “You can prompt your AI tool to render an entire scene or create assets to composite your scenes manually. When inevitable revisions arise, it’s much faster to update them through AI prompts rather than re-drawing an entire scene.” Remove Creative Blocks From creating design briefs to helping me choose color palettes, I find that AI is a great strategic partner. AI is also quite helpful when I have creative fatigue. For instance, if I am stuck on a social media campaign design, I can prompt AI tools to give me five different concepts. I can even generate creative briefs by providing the tool with additional context, such as design references, rough sketches, or campaign documents. Creative Experimentation A/B testing graphics is a huge part of my job. I’m constantly testing which graphics perform better on social media or ad variations that give us better ROAS. With AI, I can quickly spin up dozens of on-brand designs and choose the best based on audience response. The best part? AI tools help me experiment with color combinations I’d have never considered and wacky, trend-based layouts. Some AI-generated designs have actually been top performers. How I Tested the Best AI Graphic Design Tools I tested AI graphic design tools with two optimized design “mega” prompts. Basic prompts weren’t giving the output I wanted, so I decided to go all out. Each prompt covers a common marketing use case and includes detailed instructions to keep the model on track (AI can be notoriously distracted!). Prompt #1 — Blog Banner/Featured Image “Design a clean, modern blog banner for an article titled ‘The Rise of AI in Graphic Design’ using a minimalist layout (1200x628px) optimized for web and social sharing. Prioritize a bold, high-contrast headline in a contemporary, tech-inspired font. Use a subtle background texture or gradient that enhances, but doesn’t compete with, text legibility. Incorporate understated AI-themed motifs like neural nodes, abstract chips, or creative lightbulb icons. Maintain visual harmony with generous white space and balanced composition. Enhance the title’s visual impact through font weight, spacing, or soft shadowing, and ensure strong text-to-background contrast for clarity. Export as a high-res PNG or JPG.” Prompt #2 — Social Media Post “Design a high-impact Instagram post (1080x1080 px) to announce a new AI-powered design tool, featuring the bold tagline ‘Design Smarter. Not Harder.’ in large, modern sans-serif typography with layered effects, dimensional shadows, or motion-inspired blurs for depth. Use a vibrant, futuristic background with gradients (blue, purple, teal, pink), abstract shapes, and subtle tech motifs like HUD overlays or network nodes. Include the product logo or name subtly in the bottom corner, with an optional CTA like “Try It Free Today.” Ensure clean balance, mobile readability, and visual clarity on both light and dark interfaces. Export as a high-res PNG or JPG under 1MB.” Note: I also considered other factors like cost, ease of use, design capabilities, and copyright usage before arriving at my final list of AI-based graphic design tools below. Pro tip: If you want to learn how to write prompts like these, you can read my list of the 33 best ChatGPT prompts for inspiration. Best AI Tools for Graphic Design I road-tested eight tools for graphic design. Here’s what I found. 1. Canva AI I think Canva is a more accessible, intuitive version of the Adobe suite. Most freelancers rely heavily on Canva for client projects, and I can see why. Canva has stepped up its design game in the last year. I’m seeing a huge shift towards AI-assisted design workflows through its Visual Suite 2.0. I love how I can create interactive dashboards just through sheets, generate cool new backgrounds, and so much more with the new Canva. Moreover, Canva is now integrated into HubSpot, which means I can seamlessly use it inside my blogging workflow. Free resource: Learn how to use Canva in HubSpot in this Academy course. Now, let’s to use with limited features. Paid plans start from $4.55/month. Best for: Brands and marketers who have deeply integrated the Adobe suite into their workflows. 8. Designs.ai I first heard of Designs.ai as an “Agency-as-a-Service” solution and got instantly curious about the idea. Although I haven’t used it extensively (mainly due to the hefty costs) I think the idea is intriguing. You can do everything from logo design to text-to-speech for AI voiceovers using Designs.ai. For this article, I only tested the design part. Test Results You need to provide your card details to start the trial, which was quite annoying. Anyway, I went ahead with it for this article to see if it’s worth it. Here’s the output of Prompt #1. Well, at least design agencies don’t need to worry about Design.AI taking their job. At least not with banners or featured images for blogs. Let’s see if it does a better job creating graphics for social media. Except for the tagline, most of the other text is either smudged or gibberish. The layout isn’t very appealing either. As you can see, there’s an option to select the style. But every time you select a style, change the aspect ratio, or make any edits whatsoever, you need to spend 10 credits. This way, you’ll exhaust the 1000 free credits in no time, which doesn’t make this tool worth it, in my opinion. What I like: Interesting packaging and offer idea (although poor execution). Extensive product suite. What can be improved: Free trial without card info. Relaxed rates limits or higher credit availability. Pricing: 7-day free trial, followed by Basic plan starting from $29/month or $228/year ($19/month on yearly plan). Best for: Brands working on multimedia campaigns that need an integrated tool with features for video creation, such as voice-overs. Should you use AI tools for graphic design? The results of my experiment proved one thing: AI hasn’t replaced the need for good graphic designers. If anything, AI has made it more important to understand how to differentiate a good design from a bad one. My favorite AI tools in this list are ChatGPT (ideation), Canva (social media), and Ideogram (text-heavy stuff). While the concept of Autodraw was cool, I don’t think I can draw well enough to make the tool work for me. However, editing is a bit of a pain with these tools. I can tell a human designer to edit or modify an image or design, pixel by pixel, in any direction. However, when I try to work with AI, it sometimes messes up, gives me the wrong text, or generates a different image altogether. Bottom line? I’d recommend turning to AI tools for graphic design for quick mockups, ideation, or base designs. While AI does speed up the design process by a lot, you still need a professional designer to polish it and make it publish-ready.
